# Last Nite  

Last night  
She said  
Oh baby I feel so down  
Oh it turn me off  
When I feel left out  

So I  
Walked out  
Oh little girl don't care no more  
I know this for sure  
I'm walking out that door  

Well I've been in town for just about fifteen  
Oh minutes now  
And baby I feel so down  
And I don't know why  
I keep walking for miles  

And say people they don't understand  
Your girlfriends they can't understand  
Your grandsons they won't understand  
On top of this I ain't ever gonna understand  

Last night  
She said  
Oh baby don't feel so down  
Oh it turn me off  
When I feel left out  

So I  
I turned around  
Oh baby gonna be alright  
It was a great big lie  
Cause I left that night yeah  

Oh it's all right babe yeah  

Oh people they don't understand  
No girlfriends they can't understand  
In spaceships they won't understand  
On top of this I ain't ever gonna understand  

Last night  
She said  
Oh baby I feel so down  
Oh it turn me off  
When I feel left out  

So I  
I turned around  
Oh little girl don't care no more  
I know this for sure  
I'm walking out that door yeah
