# Trying Your Luck  

You said you couldn't stay  
You've seen it all before  
I know  
And sold you on their way  
Oh honey that's okay  

No harm  
He's armed  
Setting off  
All your alarms  

When I  
Find out  
I hope it's you  
Who set this trap  

And store fronts rarely change  
At least I'm on my own again  
Instead of  
Anywhere with you  
Oh tell me it's all the same  

And I've lost  
My page  
Again  

I know  
This is surreal  
But I'll try  
My luck  
With you  

Oh this life is  
On my side  
Oh I am  
Your one  

Believe me  
This is a chance  
Oh oh  

Let's see what is for sale  
He's trying not to give his job  
A chance  
Oh it's never gonna be  
It's sad but I agree  

The signals don't seem right  
It lasts for just one night and then  
I'm sorry that I said  
That we were just good friends  

No harm  
He's armed  
Setting off  
All your alarms  

Entranced  
I can't be there in time  
I'll think about that  

And I've lost  
My page  
Again  

I know  
This is surreal  
But I'll try
My luck  
With you  

Oh this life is
On my side
Well I am  
Your one  

Believe me
Oh this is a chance  
Oh oh
