# Barely Legal  

I didn't take no shortcuts  
I spent the money that I saved up  
Oh mama running out of luck  
Well like my sister don't give a fuck  

I wanna steal your innocence  
To me my life it don't make any sense  
These strange manners I loved them so  
Why won't you wear your new trench coat  

I should have worked much harder  
I should have just not bothered  
I never show up on weekdays  
And something that you learned yesterday  

Drive you to work and you'll be on time  
These little problems
They're not yours they're mine  
Come on listen to what I say  
I've got some secrets  
That'll make you stay  

I just want to turn you down  
I just want to turn you around  
Oh you ain't never had nothing I wanted but  
I want it all I just can't figure out  
Nothing  

And all together  
It went well  
We made pretend  
We were best friends  

Then she said  
Oh you're a freak  
They ordered me  
To make mistakes  

Together again  
Like the beginning  
It all works somehow  
In the end  

The things we did  
The things you hide  
But for the record  
It's between you and I  

I didn't take no shortcuts  
I spent the money that I saved up  
Oh mama running out of luck  
Well like my sister don't give a fuck  

I wanna steal your innocence  
To me my life it just don't make any sense  
Strange manners I loved them so  
Why won't you wear your new trench coat  

I just want to misbehave  
I just want to be your slave  
Oh you ain't never had nothing I wanted but  
I want it all  
I just can't figure out  
Nothing  

And all together  
It went well  
We made pretend  
We were best friends  

Then she said  
Oh I can't wait  
They ordered me  
To make mistakes  

Together again  
Like the beginning  
I all works somehow  
In the end  

The things we did  
The things you hide  
But for the record  
It's between you and I
