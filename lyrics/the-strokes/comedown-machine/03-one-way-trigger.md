# One Way Trigger  

One two three  

Get dressed in your bed  
While she's asleep  
It isn't right  
But it isn't hard  

Tell me tell me won't you understand  
Show me show me show me a better plan  

It's summer lies  
It's someone else's nothing  
Here it comes now  

You asked me to stay  
You asked me to stay  
You asked me to stay  
But there's a million reasons to leave  

Find a job  
Find a friend  
Find a home  
Find a dog  

Settle down  
Out of town  
Find a dream  
Shut it down  

Please please don't
Point it that way  
It's just a trigger that goes once  
And you'll be unafraid  

I wish that I'd been noticed  
But it never goes that way  
The silence that you brought has  
Gone gone gone  

Tell me tell me won't you understand  
Show me show me show me  

You asked me to stay  
You asked me to stay  
You asked me to stay  
But there's a million reasons to leave  

Show me what to say  
Show me what to be  
Show me what to see  
Show me what to be  

Find a job  
Find a friend  
Find a home  
Find a dog  

Settle down  
Out of town  
Find a dream  
Shut it down  

I don't wanna be in there with you  
I don't wanna be in there without your loving letter  
I waited for your thoughts  
Can't wait no longer
