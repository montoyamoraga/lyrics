# Happy Ending  

Say it all  
Just get it all off your chest  
Shake it up  
Five hundred thousand times  

Say no more  
We don't believe anything  
Teenage angst  
Comes all ages  

Baby  
Show me where to go  
Some things  
I don't wanna know  
Baby  
Tell me if you're sure  
Out all the time  

Say it all  
I'm not awake anymore  
Change my mind  
Two thousand times before  

Seen a knight  
Dance on the side of the road  
Teenage angst  
Comes all ages  

Baby  
Show me where to go  
Some things  
I don't wanna know  
Baby  
Tell me if you're sure  
Out all the time  

Feeling dizzy now  
In the running show  
All I want to see  
All I want to know  

Watch you as you stay  
Faces at your door  
Waiting for your piece  
Pull the trigger please  

Baby  
Show me where to go  
Some things  
I don't wanna know  
Baby  
Tell me if you're sure  
Out all the time  

Cause I don't wanna see  
Everybody get together  
Leave these dreams alone  
You don't wanna have to tell me that I  
Wanted you go  
Everybody needs a shadow
