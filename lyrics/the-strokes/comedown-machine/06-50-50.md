# 50/50  


Why she's telling me the story of her life  
All the things you wanna kill will give you spite  
And if you've taken all the prisoners inside  
As they're doling out their wisdom in the fire  

I will say  
I will say  
Don't judge me  

I will say  
I will say  
Don't judge me  

I wait on a darkened highway  
I wait on a darkened highway  

I can take as long as without looking by  
Why's she telling me the store of her life  
And if you've taken all the prisoners inside  
As they've thrown all their wisdom in the fire  

I will say  
I will say  
Don't judge me  

I will say  
I will say  
Don't judge me  

I wait on a darkened highway  
I wait on a darkened highway  

Once pace to tie Dan Nickton's record  
For the worst foul shooter  
In the history of the playoffs  

I will say  
I will say  
Don't judge me  

I will say  
I will say  
Don't judge me  

I wait on a darkened highway  
I wait on a darkened highway
