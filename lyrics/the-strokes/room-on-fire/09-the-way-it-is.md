# The Way It Is  

She was still sleeping
The problem will stay  
One more day  

Said she's not sorry  
The wind blows her way  
Accidents happen  
There's one planned today  
Oh you see  

I wish it was not true  
But that's the way it is  
It's not your fault  
That's the way it is  
I'm sick of you  
And that's the way it is  
And will always be  

Wednesday is over  
It's over again  
Said my goodbyes to the life  
We won't spend  
Together  

I wish it was not true  
But that's the way it is  
It's not your fault  
That's the way it is  
I'm sick of you  
And that's the way it is  

But that's not your problem  
That's not a problem  
That's not my problem  
That's not your problem
