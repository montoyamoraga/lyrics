# Red Light  

Two could be complete without the rest of the world  
Two could be complete without the rest of the world  
Do it for the people that have died for your sake  
And entire generation that has nothing to say  

How'd you make your way to me  

Oh let's say you made a deal with me  
And I got your name and your home address  
Oh you're all trashed up with your big red belt  
I would almost say that you might need help  
I could drop you off at the next red light  
If it don't make sense or it don't feel right  

All the girls could never make me  
Love them they way I love you  

Can't you see the sky is not the limit no more  
I can see the elevator crash through the floor  
I can still see yesterday sailing away  
Seven billion people who got nothing to say  

Are you coming on to me  

Well I saw your face then I heard that song  
It was so inviting it hurts my bones  
Well it looks like you but your eyes are gray  
And your hair is gone but your mind's okay  
Yes I like your smile but your forehead's cold  
I don't want you to be afraid and go  

I would cheat and lie and steal  
Now I'll stay at home and kneel for you  

I was waiting  
For my baby
To arrive  
Right by my side  

Oh please  
Leave me alone tonight  
Forget the past  

Two could be complete without the rest of the world  
Oh you know I said it just to get you to laugh  
Do it for the people that have died for your sake  
An entire generation of entertainers to blame  

The light is red the camera's on  

Get yourself a lawyer and a gun  
Hate your friend's new friends like everyone  
Childhood's end can be so competitive  
Oh the sky's not the limit  
And you're never gonna guess what is  

Oh
