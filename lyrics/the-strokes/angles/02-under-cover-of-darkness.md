# Under Cover of Darkness  

Slip back out of whack at your best  
It's a nightmare  
So I'm joining the army  

No house phones but can I still call  
Will you wait for me now  

We've got the right to live fight to use it   
Got everything but you can just choose it  
I won't just be a puppet on a string  

Don't go that way  
I'll wait for you  

I'm tired of all your friends  
Listening at your door  
I want what's better for you  

So long  
My friend  
And adversary  
But I'll wait for you  

Get dressed jump out of bed into a vest  
Are you O.K.  

I've been all around this town  
Everybody's been singing the same song for ten years  

I'll wait for you  
Will you wait for me too  

And they sacrifice their lives  
And they lied about those odds  
They'll say it a million times  
And they'll say it again  

So long  
My adversary  
And friend  

Don't go that way  
I'll wait for you  

I'm tired of all your friends  
Banging down your door  
Get up in the morning yelling no more  

So long  
My friend  
And adversary  
But I'll wait for you
