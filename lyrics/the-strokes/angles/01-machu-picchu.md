# Machu Picchu  

I'm putting your patience to the test  
I'm putting your body on the line for less  
Didn't you know there was a choice  
It's never yours but someone else's voice  

Selling your body to the street  
Sending your girlfriend's to the night for cheap  
Wearing a jacket made of meat  
Sealing a letter made with horse's feet  

And now you've heard that  

Waves turn to grey  
Life in the shade  
A violent crime  
And that's the U.S.A.  

Platinum's on the rise  
Playboys in the sky  
I'm just trying to find  
A mountain I can climb  

I'm putting your patience to the test  
I'm putting your body on the line for less  
Didn't you know there was a choice  
It's never yours but someone else's voice  

And now you see that  

Blondes turn to grey  
Life in the shade  
A violent crime  
And that's the U.S.A.  

Porn's on the rise  
Psychos in disguise    
I'm just trying to find  
A mountain I can climb  

Darling ain't nobody gonna tell us  
They're gonna be oh so jealous  
We're gonna be oh so silent  
They're gonna be stoned in silence  

I didn't want to ask you baby  
I didn't want to have to ask anyone baby  
Is anyone asking maybe  
Can anyone hear me  

Darling ain't nobody gonna tell us  
They're gonna be oh so jealous  
We're gonna be oh so silent  
They're gonna be stoned in silence  

Can anyone hear me  
Can anyone hear me  
Can anyone hear me  
Can anyone hear me  

Why are you waiting beyond the door  

Life turns to dust  
And rain turns to rust  
Gossip is a truth  
And money pays for the lies we trust  

Your love is a surprise  
Homeless saints are in disguise  
I'm just trying to find  
A nice place for you and I
