# Metabolism  

I wanna be outrageous  
But inside I know I'm plain  

So plain  
Just plain  
Boring  
And plain  

Silently obsessed with death  
Just like anyone I guess  

Trying for the perfect life  
End up being in denial  

I wanna be somebody  
Wanna be somebody like you  

Like you  
Like you  

Like you  
Instead  
Of me  

Silently obsessed with death  
Just like anyone I guess  

Trying for the perfect life  
End up being in denial
