# Our Time  

I may be dead honey  
But I was left with my eyes  

And underneath sugar  
Well I've been sunk by your lies  

And my heart baby  
Is cold and blue  

We're two of a kind lately  
Me and you  

It's our time sweet babe  
To break on through  

It's the year to be hated  
So glad that we made it  
Cause all the kids in the street   
Whisper sounds that sweet  
The stars under their feet  
Well it's the year to be hated  

One two ready go  

It's our time our time  
Our time our time  
It's our time our time  
Our time to be hated  
All right to be hated  
Come on  

Come on kids  

It's our time our time  
Our time our time  
It's our time our time  
Our time to be hated  
All right  

Well it's the year to be hated  
So glad that we made it  
Cause all the kids in the street   
Whisper sounds that sweet  
The stars under their feet  
Well it's the year to be hated  

All right  
Yeah it's the year to be hated  
Come on  
Oh it's the year to be hated  
All right  
Well it's the year to be hated
