# Graveyard  

I kiss you once I'll kiss you twice  
I kiss you once I'll kiss you twice  
I kiss you once I'll kiss you twice  
And I get the shivers cause you're cold as ice  

I'll dig you up and I'll get me some  
I'll be the one tickling right in your ear  
I'll dig your belly skin on tight  

I'll dig you you're coming home with me  
I'll dig you keep you overnight  
I'll dig you up I'll dig you up  

You take me home gonna rock a zombie  
I got an appetite for your loving  
I bring you flowers every night at ten  
Every night at ten  
Well well well well  
I got shows babe you got bone  
Oh come on  

I'll dig you up and I'll get me some  
I'll be the one in your ear  
I'll dig your belly skin on tight  

I'll dig you you're staying over here  
I'll dig you up oh overnight  
I'll dig you up I'll dig you up  

I got a heart at the cemetery  
No cheers they're really scary  
R.I.P R.I.P yeah R.I.P man right by me  
Second verse sounds good to me
