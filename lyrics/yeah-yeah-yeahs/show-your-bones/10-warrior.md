# Warrior  

When it's missing then you want it more  
It isn't right  
Turning turning out the door  
And back to his  

Leave it like it was before  
And let me out  
Must've been the end of  
The story  

Giving it all  
Giving it all away  
You're gonna wake up someone  

Well study it all  
The wings the crowd your face  
You're gonna end up like one  

Well trouble at home  
Travel the way you say  
The road don't like me  

Well travel away  
Travel it all away  
The road's gonna end on me  

Man they like me  
Cause I'm a warrior  
A warrior  

Stand on my feet  
Dance the warrior  
The warrior  

Where would I be  
I'd be a warrior  
A warrior  

Now the strangers have caught on  
And they're riding in the backseat  
The river's gonna wash all  
Yeah the river it spoke to me  

It told me I'm small  
And I swallowed it down  
If I make it at all  
I'll make you want me  

Well trouble at home  
Travel the way you say  
The road don't like me  

Well travel it all  
Travel it all away  
The road's gonna get on me  

And I'm small  
The road's gonna get on me  
Well if it gets it at all  
The road's gonna end on me  

Like a warrior  
A warrior  

Dance the warrior  
The warrior
