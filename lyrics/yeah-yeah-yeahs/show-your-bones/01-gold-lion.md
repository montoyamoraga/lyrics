# Gold Lion  

Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is  
Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is  
Take our hands out of control  
Take our hands out of control  

Now tell me what you saw  
Tell me what you saw  
There was a crowd of seeds  
Inside outside  
I must have done a dozen each  

It was the height I grew  
The weight the shell was crushing you  
I've been around a few  
Tell me what you saw  
I'll tell you what to  

Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  

Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  

Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is  
Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is  
Take our hands out of control  
Take our hands out of control  

Outside inside  
This is a moon without a tide  
We'll build a fire in your eyes  
We'll build a fire  
When the cover's getting brighter  
Cold desire makes a moon without a tide  

Tell me what you saw  
I'll tell you what to  

Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  

Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  

Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  

Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh
