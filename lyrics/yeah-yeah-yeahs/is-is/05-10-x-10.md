Ten by ten  
Three by three  
Was the house that buried me  
Did I really drown  

Ten lines leading to the seashore  
Water's gonna lead the dogs my way  
Ten wives tearing up my leisure  
Pressing little mouths gonna talk my way  
Gonna talk my way  

Uh huh  

Out of my mind  
Out of my mind  
Stole my wife  
Stole my knife  

Gonna take her   
Into my life  
Into my life  

Three nails pounded in the front door  
Start a few fires and end my stay  
Well even the urges in the backporch  
Crusted little mouths gonna talk my way  
Gonna talk my way  

Uh huh  

Out of my mind  
Out of my mind  
Stole my wife  
Stole my knife  

Gonna take her   
Into my
Into my life  
Into my life  

Ten by ten  
Three by three  
Was the house that buried me
