# Soft Shock  

Unknown  
Talk to unknown  
Ever  
Lasts forever  

Well it's a  
Sharp shock  
To your soft side  

Summer moon  
Catch your  
Shut eye  

In your room  
In my room  

In your room  
In my room  

Louder  
Lips  
Speak louder  

Better  
Back  
Together  

Still it's a  
Sharp shock  
To your  
Soft side  

Summer moon  
Catch your  
Shut eye  

In my room  
In your room  

In my room  
In your room  

Hey  

What's the time  
What's the day  
Go and leave me  

What's the time  
What's the day  
Go and leave me  

What's the time  
What's the day  
Go and leave me  

What's the time  
What's the day  
Go and leave me out  

Leave me out  
Leave me out  
Leave me out
