# Zero  

Shake it like a ladder to the sun  
Makes me feel like a madman on the run  
Find me never never far gone  
So get your leather leather leather on on on on  

You're a zero  
What's your name  
No one's gonna ask you  
Better find out where they want you  

To go  
Try and hit the spot  
Get to know it in the dark  
Get to know it whether you're a  

Crime crime crime of love  
Can you  
Climb climb climb higher  

Shake it like a ladder to the sun

No one's gonna ask you  
Better find out where they want you

Get to know it in the dark  
Get to know it whether you're a  

Crime crime crime of love  
Can you

Shell shock  
Was it the cure  
Hope not

Crime crime crime of love

Climb climb climb higher
