Prognostic figure of speech to manifesto  
Doctor Octagon move in the dark though  
Multiply darkness I'm the bright artist  
Hologram image on the interface  

Manage the code to bury them alive  
Manage the code to bury them inside  
Show smoke from the smoke machine  
Lights on top flash purple and green  

Purple and mean rise with the vampires  
Look over skies from a high rise  
Doc Oc operate by the clock  
Medicine bag come down by your block  

Raise the dead hypnotize with your head  
Chemical react surgery to your head  
Eyeballs up all night turn red
