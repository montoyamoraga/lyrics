# These Paths  

These paths  
Will cross  
Again  
Again  

These pants  
Rubbed off  
Against  
Against  

These paths  
Will cross  
Again  
Again  

These pants  
Rubbed off  
Against  
Against  

Take your seat  
On the tip  
Of the star  
That you sit  

Take your piece  
Take a sip  
Or you'll starve  
From that shit  

Take your piece  
Of that star  
Take your piece  
Of that kid  

Take your piece  
Or you'll starve  
Take your piece  
Take it kid  

These paths  
Will cross  
Again  
Again  

These pants  
Come off  
Against  
Against  

Take your seat  
On the tip  
Of the star  
That you sit  

Take your piece  
Take a sip  
Or you'll starve  
From that shit  

Take your piece  
Of that star  
Take your piece  
Of that kid  

Take your piece  
Or you'll starve  
Take your piece  
Take it kid  

These paths  
Will cross  
I guess
Again  

These pants  
Come off  
Against  
Against  

Take your seat  
On the tip  
Of the star  
That you sit  

Take your piece  
Take a sip  
Or you'll starve  
From that shit  

Take your piece  
Of that star  
Take your piece  
Of that kid  

Take your piece  
Or you'll starve  
Take your piece  
Take it kid
