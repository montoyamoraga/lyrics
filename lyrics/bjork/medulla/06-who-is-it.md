# Who Is It  (Carry My Joy On The Left, Carry My Pain On The Right)  

His embrace a fortress  
It fuels me and places  
A skeleton of trust  

Right beneath us  
Bone by bone  
Stone by stone  

If you ask yourself  
Patiently  
And carefully  
Who is it  
Who is it  

Who is it  
That never lets you down  
Who is it  
That gave you back your crown  

And the ornaments are
They are going around  
Now they're handing it over  
Handing it over  
Handing it over  

Who is it  
That never lets you down  
Who is it  
That gave you back your crown  

And the ornaments are
They are going around  
Now they're handing it over  
Handing it over  
Handing it over  

Handing it over  
Handing it over  
Handing it over  

He demands  
A closeness  
We all have earned  
A lightness  

Carry my joy  
On the left  
Carry my pain  
On the right  

If you ask yourself  
Now patiently  
And carefully  
Who is it  

Who is it  
That never lets you down  
Who is it  
That gave you back your crown  

And the ornaments are
They are going around  
Now they're handing it over  
Handing it over  
Handing it over  

Who is it  
That never lets you down  
Who is it  
That gave you back your crown  

And the ornaments are
They are going around  
Now they're handing it over  
Handing it over  
Handing it over  

Handing it over  
Handing it over  
Handing it over
