# Mouths Cradle  

There is yet  
Another one  
That follows me  
Wherever I go

And supports me  
Oh this tooth
Is warmth like  
Oh this tooth
Is warmth like  
Oh this tooth
Is warmth like  

And these teeth  
Are a ladder that I walk
Towards the mouth  
Towards the mouth  

That you can walk too if you want  
If you want up to the mouth  
The mouth's cradle  
Up to the mouth's cradle  

He always has a hope for me  
Always sees me  
When nothing else  
And everyone have left  

That ghost is brighter than anyone  
And fulfills me with hope  

And you can use  
These teeth as a ladder  
Up to the mouth's cradle  
The mouth's cradle  

And you can follow  
These notes I'm singing  
Up to the mouth's cradle  
The mouth's cradle  

The simplicity of the ghost-like beast  
The purity of what it wants and where it goes  

Always love  
Always loves you  
Always loves you  
Infrared love  

And you can use  
These teeth as a ladder  
Up to the mouth's cradle  
The mouth's cradle  

And you can follow  
These notes I'm singing  
Up to the mouth's cradle  
The mouth's cradle  

I need a shelter to build an altar away  
From all osamas and bushes
