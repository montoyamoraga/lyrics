# It's Oh So Quiet  

Sh Sh
It's oh so quiet  
Sh sh  
It's oh so still
Sh sh  
You're all alone  
Sh sh  
And so peaceful until  

You fall in love  
Zing boom  
The sky up above  
Zing boom  
Is caving in  
Wow bam  

You've never so nuts about a guy  
You want to laugh you want to cry  
You cross your heart and hope to die  

Til it's over and then  
Sh sh  
It's nice and quiet  
Sh sh  
But soon again  
Sh sh  
Starts another big riot  

You blow a fuse  
Zing boom  
The devil cuts loose  
Zing boom  
So what's the use  
Wow bam  
Of falling in love  

It's oh so quiet  
It's oh so still  
You're all alone  
And so peaceful until  

You ring the bell  
Bim bam  
You shout and you yell  
Ha ho ho  
You broke the spell  

Gee this is swell you almost have a fit  
This guy is gorge and I got hit  
There's no mistake this is it  

Til it's over and then  
It's nice and quiet  
Sh sh  
But soon again  
Sh sh  
Starts another big riot  

You blow a fuse  
Zing boom  
The devil cuts loose  
Zing boom  
So what's the use  
Wow bam  
Of falling in love  

The sky caves in  
The devil cuts loose  
You blow blow blow blow blow blow your fuse  
When you fall in love  

Sh
