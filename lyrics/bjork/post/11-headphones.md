# Headphones  

Genius to fall asleep  
To your tape last night  
So warm  

Sounds go through the muscles  
These abstract wordless movements  
Move move move move move  

They start off cells that haven't  
Been touched before  
These cells are virgins  

Waking up slowly  
Waking up  
Waking up slowly  
Waking up  

My headphones  
They saved my life  
Your tape  
It lulled me to sleep  
To sleep to sleep  

Nothing will be the same  
I'm asleep  
I'm fast asleep  

I like this resonance  
It elevates me  
I don't recognize myself  
This is very interesting  

My headphones  
They saved my life  
Your tape  
It lulled me to sleep  
To sleep to sleep  

I'm fast asleep now  
You're still with me  
I'm fast asleep  
I'm asleep  

My headphones  
They saved my life  
Your tape  
It lulled me to sleep  
To sleep to sleep
