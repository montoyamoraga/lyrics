# I Miss You  

I miss you  
But I haven't met you yet  
So special  
But it hasn't happened yet  

You are gorgeous  
But I haven't met you yet  
I remember  
But it hasn't happened yet  

And if you believe in dreams  
Or what is more important  
That a dream can come true  
I will meet you  

I was peaking  
But it hasn't happened yet  
I haven't been given  
My best souvenir  

I miss you  
But I haven't met you yet  
I know your habits
But wouldn't recognize you yet  

And if you believe in dreams  
Or what is more important  
That a dream can come true  
I miss you  

I'm so impatient  
I can't stand the wait  
When will I get my cuddle?  
Who are you?  
I know by now that you'll arrive  
By the time I stop waiting  

I miss you
