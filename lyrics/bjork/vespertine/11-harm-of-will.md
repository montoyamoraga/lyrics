# Harm Of Will  

If there is a troubadour washing  
It is he  
If there is a man about town  
It is he  

If there is one to be sought  
It is he  
If there are nine she's  
They are bought for me  

This way is  
As is she  
And he placed her unclothed  
Long long long legged  

On top of the family tree  

And if he has chosen the point  
While she is under him  
Then leave her coily placed  
Crouched sucking him  
For it is I  
With her on knee  

I leave her  
Without pith or feel  
And leave her be  
Leave it be  

For he controls  
What there'll be  
He makes his face  
Known to none  

For if he is seen  
Then all will  
And all will know  
Know me
