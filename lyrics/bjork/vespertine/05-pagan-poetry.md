# Pagan Poetry  

Pedaling through  
The dark currents  
I find an accurate copy  
A blueprint of the pleasure in me  

Swirling back lilies totally ripe  
A secret code carved  
A secret code carved  
Swirling back lilies totally ripe  

He offers a handshake  
Crooked five fingers  
They form a pattern  
Yet to be matched  

On the surface simplicity  
Swirling back lilies totally ripe  
But the darkest pit in me  

And it's pagan poetry  
Swirling back lilies totally ripe  
Pagan poetry  

Morse coding signals  
Signals  
They pulsate  
Wake me up  
They wake me up  
Pulsate  
From my hibernating  

On the surface simplicity  
Swirling back lilies totally ripe  
But the darkest pit in me  

And it's pagan poetry
Swirling back lilies totally ripe  
Pagan poetry  

Swirling back lilies totally ripe  
Swirling back lilies totally ripe
