# Heirloom  

I have a recurrent dream  
Every time I lose my voice  
I swallow little glowing lights  
My mother and son baked for me  

During the nights  
They do a trapeze walk  
Until they're in the sky  
Right above my bed  

While I'm asleep  
My mother and son pour into me  
Warm glowing oil  
Into my wide open throat  

I have a recurrent dream  
Every time I feel a hoarseness  
I swallow warm glowing lights  
My mother and son baked for me oh  

They make me feel so much better  
They make me feel better  

We have a recurrent dream  
Every time we lose our voices  
We dream swallow little lights  
Our mother and son bake for us  

During the nights  
They do a little trapeze walk  
Until they're in the sky  
Right above our heads  

While we're asleep  
My mother and son pour into us  
Warm glowing oil  
Into our wide open throats  

I have a recurrent dream  

They make me feel better  
They make me feel better
