# Aurora  

Threading  
The glacier head  
Looking hard for  
Moments of shine  
From twilight  
To twilight  

Aurora  
Utter mundane  

Aurora  
Goddess sparkle  
Shoot me  
Beyond this suffer  
The need  
Is great  

Aurora  
Utter mundane  

Aurora  
Goddess sparkle  
A mountain shade  
Suggests your shape  
I tumbled down  
On my knees  
Fill the mouth  
With snow  

The way it melts  
I wish  
To melt  
Into you  

Aurora  
Utter mundane  

Spark the sun off  
Spark the sun off  
Spark the sun off  
Spark the sun off  

Spark the sun off  
Spark the sun off  
Spark the sun off me
Spark the sun off me
