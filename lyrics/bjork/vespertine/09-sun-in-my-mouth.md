# Sun In My Mouth  

I will wade out  
Till my thighs are steeped  
In burning flowers  
I will take the sun in my mouth  

And leap into the ripe air  
Alive with closed eyes  
To dash against darkness  

In the sleeping curves of my body  
I shall enter fingers  
Of smooth mastery  
With chasteness of seagulls  

Will I complete the mystery  
Of my flesh  

Will I complete the mystery  
Of my flesh  

Of my flesh
