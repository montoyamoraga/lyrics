# Claimstaker  

I walk through this land  
Stake a claim  
With my sense  
With my bark  
Mark my nest with song  
Hear the the echo  
Echo from that cliff  
I draw laser line  
Through lake  

To take  
A physicality  
I inhale  
This physicality  

This forest  
Is in me  
This forest  
Is in me  
I immerse me  

This is my home  
This is  
This is my home  
This is
