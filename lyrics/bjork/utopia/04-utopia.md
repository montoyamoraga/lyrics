# Utopia  

Bird species never seen or heard before  
The first flute carved from the first fauna  

Utopia  
It's not elsewhere  
Let's purify  

You assigned me to protect our lantern  
To be intentional about the light  

Utopia  
It isn't elsewhere  
It's here  

My instinct has been shouting at me for years  
Saying let's go out of here  
Huge toxic tumor bulging underneath the ground here  
Purify purify purify purify toxicity
