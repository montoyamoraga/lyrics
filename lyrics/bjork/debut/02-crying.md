# Crying  

I travel  
All around the city  
Go in and out of  
Locomotives  
All alone  

There's no one here  
And people everywhere  

Crying cause I need you  
Crying I can feel you  
Crying cause I need you  
Crying cause I care  

It's a hot day  
And I'm dressed lightly  
I move carefully  
Through the crowd  
Here everyone  
Are so vulnerable  
And I'm as well  

There's no one here  
And people everywhere  

Crying cause I need you  
Crying I can feel you  
Crying cause I need you  
Crying cause I care  

Only if a ship would sail in  
Or just somebody came  
And knocked on my door  
Or just or just something  

Crying cause I need you  
Crying I can feel you  
Crying cause I need you  
Crying cause I care
