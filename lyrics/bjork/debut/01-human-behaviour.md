# Human Behaviour  

If you ever get close to a human  
And human behaviour  
Be ready be ready to get confused  
And me and my hereafter  

There's definitely definitely no logic  
To human behaviour  
But yet so yet so irresistible  
And me and my fear can  

And there is no map  
Uncertain  

They're terribly terribly terribly moody  
Oh human behaviour  
Then all of a sudden turn happy  
And they and my hereafter  

But oh to get involved in the exchange  
Of human emotions  
Is ever so ever so satisfying  
And they and my here oh  

And there is no map  
Uncertain  

Human behaviour  
Human human  
Human behaviour  
Human human  

Human behaviour  
Human human  
Human behaviour  
Human human  

And there is no map  
And a compass wouldn't help at all  
Yeah uncertain  

Human behaviour  
Human human  
Human behaviour  
Human human  

Human behaviour  
Human human  
Human behaviour  
Human human  

There's definitely  
Definitely no logic  

To human  
To human  
To human  
To human
