# Come To Me  

Come to me  
I'll take care of you  
Protect you  
Calm calm down  

You're exhausted  
Come lie down  
You don't have to explain  
I understand  

You know  
That I adore you  
You know  
That I love you  

So don't make me say it  
It would burst the bubble  
Break the charm  

Jump off  
Your building's on fire  
And I'll catch you  
I'll catch you  

Destroy all that  
Is keeping you down  
And then I'll nurse you  
I'll nurse you  

I'll protect you  

You know  
That I adore you  
You know  
That I love you  

So don't make me say it  
It would burst the bubble  
Break the charm
