# Alarm Call  

I have walked this earth  
And watched people  
It doesn't scare me at all  

I can be sincere  
And say I like them  
It doesn't scare me at all  

You can't say no to hope  
Can't say no to happiness  
It doesn't scare me at all  

I want to go on a mountaintop  
With a radio and good batteries  
And play a joyous tune and  

Free the human race  
From suffering  
It doesn't scare me at all  

I'm no fucking buddhist  
But this is enlightenment  

The less room you give me  
The more space I've got  
It doesn't scare me at all  

You can't say no to hope  
Can't say no to happiness  
It doesn't scare me at all  

I want to be on a mountaintop  
With a radio and good batteries  
And play a joyous tune and  

Free the human race  
From suffering  
It doesn't scare me at all  

This is an alarm call  
So wake up wake up now  

Today has never happened  
And it doesn't frighten me  
It doesn't scare me at all  

You can't say no to hope  
You can't say no to happiness  

It doesn't scare me at all  
It doesn't scare me at all  
It doesn't scare me at all  
It doesn't scare me at all  

It doesn't scare me at all  
It doesn't scare me at all  
It doesn't scare me at all  
It doesn't scare me at all
