# All Is Full Of Love  

You'll be given love  
You'll be taken care of  
You'll be given love  
You have to trust it  

Maybe not from the sources  
You have poured yours  
Maybe not from the directions  
You are staring at  

Twist your head around  
It's all around you  
All is full of love  
All around you  

All is full of love  
You just ain't receiving  
All is full of love  
Your phone is off the hook  
All is full of love  
Your doors are all shut  
All is full of love  

All is full of love  
All is full of love  
All is full of love  
All is full of love  
All is full of love  
All is full of love  

All is full of love  
All is full of love  
All is full of love  
All is full of love
