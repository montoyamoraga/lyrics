# All Neon Like  

Not til you halo all over me  
I'll come over  
Not til it shimmers around your skull  
I'll be yours  

I weave for you  
The marvelous web  
Glow in the dark threads  
All neon like  

The cocoon surrounds you  
Embraces all  
So you can sleep  
Fetus style  

And they will assist us  
Cause we're asking for help  
And the luminous beam  
It feeds you  

The soft distortion  
Fills you up  
Nourish nourish  
Your turtle heart  

And they will assist us  
Cause we're asking for help  
And the luminous beam  
It feeds you  

Don't get angry with yourself  
Don't don't get angry with yourself  
I'll heal you  

With a razor blade  
I'll cut a slit open  
And the luminous beam  
Heals you honey heals you  

Don't get angry with yourself  
Don't get angry with yourself  
Don't get angry with yourself  
Don't get angry with yourself  

I'll heal you  
I'll heal you  
Luminous  
I'll heal you  
I'll heal you
