# Bachelorette  

I'm a fountain of blood  
In the shape of a girl  
You're the bird on the brim  
Hypnotized by the whirl  

Drink me make me feel real  
Wet your beak in the stream  
Game we're playing is life  
Love's a two way dream  

Leave me now return to me  
Tide will show you the way  
If you forget my name  
You will go astray  
Like a killer whale  
Trapped in a bay  

I'm a path of cinders  
Burning under your feet  
You're the one who walks me  
I'm your one way street  

I'm a whisper in the water  
Secret for you to hear  
You are the one who grows distant  
When I beckon you near  

Leave me now return tonight  
The tide will show you the way  
If you forget my name  
You will go astray  
Like a killer whale  
Trapped in a bay  

I'm a tree that grows hearts  
One for each that you take  
You're the intruder's hand  
I'm the branch that you break
