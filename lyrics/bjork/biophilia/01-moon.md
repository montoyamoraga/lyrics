# Moon

As the lukewarm  
Hands of the gods  
Came down and gently  
Picked my adrenalin pearls  
They placed them in their mouths  
And rinsed all the fear out  
Nourished them with their saliva  

Rested  
Ooh
As if the healthiest past time  
Is being in life threatening circumstances  
And once again be reborn  

All birthed and happy  
All birthed and happy  

All birthed and happy  
All birthed and happy  

All birthed and happy  
All birthed and happy  

Best way to start anew  
Is to fail miserably  
Fail at loving   
And fail at giving  
Fail at creating a flow  
Then realign the whole  

And kick into the start hole  
And kick into the start hole  
And kick into the start hole  

To risk all  
Is the end all  
And the beginning all  

To risk all  
Is the end all  
And the beginning all
