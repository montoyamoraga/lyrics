# Crystalline  

Underneath our feet  
Crystals grow like plants  
Listen how they grow  
I'm blinded by the lights  
Listen how they grow  
In the core of the earth  
Listen how they glow  

Crystalline  
Internal nebula  
Crystalline  
Rocks growing slow-mo   
Crystalline  
I conquer claustrophobia  
Crystalline  
And demand the light  

We mimic the openness  
Of the ones we love  
Dovetail our generosity  
Equalize the flow  
With our hearts  
We chisel quartz  
To reach love  

Crystalline  
Internal nebula  
Crystalline  
Rocks growing slow-mo  
Crystalline  
I conquer claustrophobia  
Crystalline  
And demand the light  

Octagon polygon  
Pipes up an organ  
Sonic branches  
Murmuring drone  
Crystalizing galaxies  
Spread out like my fingers  

Crystalline  
Internal nebula  
Crystalline  
Rocks growing slow-mo  
Crystalline  
I conquer claustrophobia  
Crystalline  
And demand the light  

Crystalline  
Listen how they grow  
Internal nebula  
Crystalline  
Listen how they grow  
Rocks growing slow-mo  
Crystalline  
Listen how they grow  
I conquer claustrophobia  
Crystalline  
Listen how they grow  
And demand the light  

It's the sparkle you become  
When you conquer anxiety  
It's the sparkle you become  
When you conquer anxiety
