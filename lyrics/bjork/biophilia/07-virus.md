# Virus  

Like a virus needs a body  
As soft tissue feeds on blood  
Some day I'll find you  
The urge is here  

Like a mushroom on a tree trunk  
As the protein transmutates  
I knock on your skin and I am in  

The perfect match you and me  
I adapt contagious  
You open up say welcome  

Like a flame that seeks explosives  
As gunpowder needs a war  
I feast inside you my host is you  

The perfect match you and I  
You fail to resist  
My crystalline charm  

Like a virus patient hunter  
I'm waiting for you  
I'm starving for you  

My sweet adversary  
My sweet adversary  
My sweet adversary
