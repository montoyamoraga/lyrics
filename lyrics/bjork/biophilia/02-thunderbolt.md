# Thunderbolt  

Stirring at water's edge  
Cold froth on my twig  
My mind in whirls  
Wanders around desire  

May I can I or have I too often  
Craving miracles  

May I can I or have I too often now  
Craving miracles  
Craving miracles  

No one imagines the light shock I need  
And I'll never know  
From whose hands deeply humble  
Dangerous gifts as such to mine come  

May I can I or have I too often  
Craving miracles  

May I can I or have I too often  
Craving miracles  
Craving miracles  

My romantic gene is dominant  
And it hungers for union  
Universal intimacy  
All embracing  

May I can I or have I too often  
Craving miracles  

May I can I or have I too often now  
Craving miracles  
Craving   

Waves irregularly striking  
Wind stern in my face  
Thunderstorm come  
Scrape those barnacles of me  

May I may I or should I too often  
Craving miracles  

May I or should I or have I too often  

All my body parts are one  
As lightning hits my spine  
Sparkling  
Prime runs through me  
Revive my wish  
Inviolable  

May I can I or have I too often  
Craving miracles  

May I can I should I or have I too often  
Craving miracles
