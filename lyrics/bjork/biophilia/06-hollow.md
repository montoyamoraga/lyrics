# Hollow  

Hollow  
My ancestors have access  
Hollow  
I'm falling down the abyss  
Hollow  
Looking for some answers  

Generations of mothers  
Sailing in  
Somehow they all were  
Ship folks  

Hollow  
The ground is opening up  
Swallows me up  
The trunk of DNA  
The trunk of DNA trunk  

Now come forth all species  
Hollow  
Like a bead in necklace  
Thread me upon this chain  
I'm part of it oh  
The everlasting necklace  

Jewels after jewels after jewels after  
Jewels after jewels  

I yearn to belong  
Let me belong  
Let me belong
