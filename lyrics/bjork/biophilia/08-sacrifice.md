# Sacrifice  

Why can't you give her room  
Respect her spatial needs  
I feel you compress her  
Into a small space  

With clairvoyance  
She knew what you needed  
And she gave it to you  
Now her desires are repressed  
Arrows in the flesh  

When she  
When she found your love  
Her nature bowed her head  
She surrendered  
She renounced the world for you  
Now she's poisoned by demands  
You cannot answer  

Why this sacrifice  
Now she regrets the whole thing  
A delayed reaction  
When she left her craft voluntarily  
For your nest  
For your love  
Did you understand  
Appreciate  

Build a bridge to her  
Initiate a touch  
Before it's too late  
Say the words to her  
That will make her shine  
Tell her that you love her  

Your generosity will show  
In the volume of her glow  

Your generosity will show  
In the volume of her glow  

Your generosity will show  
In the volume of her glow
