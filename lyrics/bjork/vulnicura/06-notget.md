# Notget  

Once you fell out of love  
Our love couldn't carry you  
And I didn't even notice  
For our love kept me safe from death  

You doubted the light  
And the shelter it can give  
For in love we are immortal  
Eternal and safe from death  

If I regret us  
I'm denying my soul to grow  
Don't remove my pain  
It is my chance to heal  

We carry the same wound  
But have different cures  
Similar injuries  
But opposite remedies  

After our love ended  
Your arms don't carry me  
Without love I feel the abyss  
Understand your fear of death  

I will not forget  
This notget  
Will you not regret  
Having love let go  

After our love ended  
Your spirit ended me  
Now we are the guardians  
We'll keep her safe from death  

Love will keep us safe from death  
Love will keep us safe from death  
Love will keep us safe from death  
Safe safe from

Love will keep us safe from death  
Love will keep us safe from death  
Love will keep us safe from death  
Love will keep us safe from death
