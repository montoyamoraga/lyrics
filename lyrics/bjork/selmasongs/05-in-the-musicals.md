# In The Musicals  

Why do I love it so much  
What kind of magic is this  
How come I can't help adore it  
It's just another musical  

No one minds it at all  
If I'm having a ball  
This is a musical  

And there's always someone to catch me  
There's always someone to catch me  
There's always someone to catch me  
There's always someone to catch me  
When you fall  

Why do I love you so much  
What kind of magic is this  
How come I can't help adore you  
You were in a musical  

I don't mind it at all  
If I'm having a ball  
This is a musical  

And you were always there to catch me  
You were always there to catch me  
You were always there to catch me  
You were always there to catch me  
When I fall  

I don't mind it at all  
If you're having a ball  
This is a musical  

And I will always be there to catch you  
I'll always be there to catch you  
I'll always be there to catch you  
I'll always be there to catch you  

You were always there to catch me  
And there's always someone to catch me  
You will always be there to catch me  
You were always there to catch me  

When I'd fall
