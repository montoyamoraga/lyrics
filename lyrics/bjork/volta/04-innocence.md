# Innocence  

I once had no fears  
None at all  
And then when  
I had some  

To my surprise  
I grew to like both  
Scared or brave  
Without them  

The thrill of fear  
Thought I'd never  
Admit it  

The thrill of fear  
Now greatly enjoyed  
With courage  

When I once was  
Untouchable  
Innocence roared  
Still amazes  

When I once was  
Innocent  
It is still here  
But in different places  

Neurosis  
Only  
Attaches  
Itself to  

Fertile  
Ground  
Where it can  
Flourish  

The thrill of fear  
Thought I'd never  
Admit it  

The thrill of fear  
Now greatly enjoyed  
With courage  

When I once was  
Fearless  
Innocence roared  
Still amazes  

Untouchable  
Innocence  
It is still here  
But in different places  

Fear is a  
Powerful drug  
Overcome it  
And you think  
That you can do  
Anything  

Should I  
Save myself  
For later  
Or generously give  

Fear of  
Losing  
Energy  
Is draining  

It locks up your chest  
Shuts down the heart  
Miserly  
And stingy  

Let's open up
