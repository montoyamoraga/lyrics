# Infinity  

After all the time  
After you  
Had you seen me with someone new  
Hanging so high for your return  
But the stillness is a burn  
Had I seen it in your eyes  
There'd have been no try after try  
Your leaving had no goodbye  
Had I just seen one in your eyes  

I can't give it up  
To someone else's touch  
Because I care too much  

I can't give it up  
To someone else's touch  
Because I care too much  

Care too much  
Care too much  

Could you tell  
I was left lost and lonely  
Could you tell  
Things ain't worked out my way  

Wish the best for you  
Wish the best for me  
Wished for infinity  

If that ain't me  
Then give it up  
I can't give it up  
Give it up  
I can't give it up  

I can't give it up  
To someone else's touch  
Because I care too much  

I can't give it up  
To someone else's touch  
Because I care too much  

Care too much  
Care too much  

Give it up  
I can't give it up  
Give it up  
I can't give it up  

Give it up  
I can't give it up  
Give it up  
I can't give it up  

Give it up  
I can't give it up  
Give it up  
I can't give it up  

Give it up  
I can't give it up  
Give it up  
I can't give it up
