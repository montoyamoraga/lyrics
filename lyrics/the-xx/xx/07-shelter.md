# Shelter  

I find shelter in this way  
Under cover hideaway  
Can you hear when I say  
I have never felt this way  

Maybe I had said something that was wrong  
Can I make it better with the lights turned on  
Maybe I had said something that was wrong  
Can I make it better with the lights turned on  

Could I be was I there  
It felt so crystal in the air  
I still want to drown whenever you leave  
Please teach me gently how to breathe  

And I'll cross oceans like never before  
So you can feel the way I feel it too  
And I'll mirror images back at you  
So you can see the way I feel it too  

Maybe I had said something that was wrong  
Can I make it better with the lights turned on  
Maybe I had said something that was wrong  
Can I make it better with the lights turned on  

Maybe I had said something that was wrong  
Can I make it better with the lights turned on  
Maybe I had said something that was wrong  
Can I make it better with the lights turned on  

Maybe I had said something that was wrong  
Can I make it better with the lights turned on  
Maybe I had said something that was wrong  
Can I make it better with the lights turned on
