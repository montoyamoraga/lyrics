# Fantasy  

For the desired effect  
Would you come back August or June June  
And I hate that tomorrow's too soon  
But this collision came mid-bloom  
Better built to resume  
I'll see you August see you June  
I'm building higher than I can see  
I want fantasy  
Don't rest with the less  
I'm burning to impress  
It's deep in the middle of me  
I can be fantasy
