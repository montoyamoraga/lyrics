# Tides  

You leave with the tide  
And I can't stop you leaving  
I can see it in your eyes  
Some things have lost their meaning  

Devote to me  
Alone with me  
Say with me  
Why would ever want to leave  

You leave with the tide  
And I can't stop you leaving  
I can see it in your eyes  
Some things have lost their meaning  

Fade out of view  
I wouldn't do that to you  
I wouldn't just leave us alone  
When we could be close close close  

Hold me close  
When you could leave us alone  
Why would you just leave us alone  
When we have been close close  

You leave with the tide  
And I can't stop you leaving  
I can see it in your eyes  
Some things have lost their meaning  

You leave with the tide  
And I can't stop you leaving  
I can see it in your eyes  
Some things have lost their meaning
