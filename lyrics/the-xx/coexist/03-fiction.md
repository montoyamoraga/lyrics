Fiction  
When we're not together  
Mistaken for a vision  
Something of my own creation  

I wake up alone  
With only daylight between us  
Last night the world was beneath us  
Tonight comes dear love  

We'll be torn apart  
By the break of day  
You're more than I can believe  
Would ever come my way  

Fiction  
When we're not together  
Mistaken for a vision  
Something of my own creation  

Come real love  
Why do I refuse you  
Cause if my fear's right  
I risk to lose you  

And if I just mind  
And wake up alone  
Bring on the night  

Fiction  
When we're not together  
Mistaken for a vision  
Something of my own creation  

And it's certainly  
How am I to tell  
I know your face all too well  
Still I wake up alone  

Fiction  
When we're not together
