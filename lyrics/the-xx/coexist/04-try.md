# Try  

We bide our time  
Though the time is fine  
Oh to be there  
I could be there  
Say you'll be there  

You know the way I  
Can't resist you I  
Said to myself I'd try  

Why do we waste time  
Hiding it inside  
I want you to be mine  

Now it's dead and gone  
You say what you would've done  
You would've been there  
I wish you'd been there  
I needed you there  

And if we try once more  
Wouldn't you give me it all  
I won't believe it  
Til I can feel it  
Can you feel it  

You know the way I  
Can't resist you I  
Said to myself I'd try
