# Our Song  

All I have  
I will give to you  
In dark times  
When no wants to  
I will give  
You me  
And we'll be  
Us  

All I have  
I will give to you  
In dark times  
When no wants to  
I will give  
You me  
And we'll be  
Us  

And there's no one else  

Who knows me  
Like you do  
All I've done  
You've done too  

The walls I  
Hide behind  
You walk through  
You just walk through  

Well I know all the words  
To take you apart  
You know I know you're hurt  
I want to mend your heart  

You're broke down  
Why don't you tell me from the start  
You know I know you're hurt  
I want to mend your heart  

And there's no one else  

Who knows me  
Like you do  
All I've done  
You've done too  

The walls I  
Hide behind  
You walk through  
You just walk through
