# A Violent Noise  

If I'm beating every hand away  
No one stays  
I've got so cautious  

And now I choke on every move I make  
Let one play  
To be that careless  

With every kiss from a friend  
With everything I pretend  
Not to feel  

Am I too high am I too proud  
Is the music too loud  
For me to hear  

Now I go out  
But every beat is a violent noise  
Try as I might  
With every beat comes a violent noise  

The melody's sung  
And I don't know the voice  
Now I go out  
But every beat is a violent noise  

You've been staying out late  
Trying your best to escape  
I hope you find what you're looking for  

Let a moment take place  
Without running away  
I hope you silence the noise  

How could eyes this wide  
Lose sight of a world outside  
I've looked away  
Cowardice  

With every kiss from a friend  
With everything I pretend
Not to feel  

Am I too high am I too proud  
Is the music too loud  
For me to hear  

Now I go out  
But every beat is a violent noise  
Try as I might  
With every beat comes a violent noise  

The melody's sung  
And I don't know the voice  
Now I go out  
But every beat is a violent noise
