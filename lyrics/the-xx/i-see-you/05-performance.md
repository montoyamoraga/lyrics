# Performance  

If I scream at the top of my lungs  
Will you hear what I don't say  
If I dance like I'm on a stage  
Will you see I seem out of place  

If I put on a disguise  
Will you think everything's alright  
If I leave before the end  
Will you forget that I was there  

When you saw me leaving  
Did you think I had a place to go  
Since you stopped believing  
I've had to put on my own show  

I'll put on a performance  
I'll put on a show  
It is a performance  
I do it all so  

You won't see me hurting  
When my heart it breaks  
I'll put on a performance  
I'll put on a brave face  

Even when I was hiding  
You could always find me  
Now you've stopped looking for me  
But I'm still playing hide and seek  

I want you to notice  
But you just don't see  
The show is wasted on you  
So I perform for me  

When you saw me leaving  
Did you think I had a place to go  
Since you stopped believing  
I've had to put on my own show  

I'll put on a performance  
I'll put on a show  
It is a performance  
I do it all so  

You won't see me hurting  
When my heart it breaks  
I'll put on a performance  
I'll put on a brave face
