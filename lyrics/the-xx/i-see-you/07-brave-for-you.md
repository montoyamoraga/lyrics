# Brave For You  

In all I know  
In all I've done  
I take you along  

Though you're not here  
I can feel you there  
I take you along  

And when I'm scared  
I imagine you're there  
Telling me to be brave  

So I will be brave for you  
Stand on a stage for you  
Do the things that I'm afraid to do  
I know you want me to  
I will be brave  

I know you want me to  

I see things change  
And I watch them grow  
And I know you do too  

When the things don't make sense  
I have courage  
Because of you  

And when I'm scared  
I imagine you're there  
Telling me to be brave  

So I will be brave for you  
Stand on a stage for you  
Do the things that I'm afraid to do  
I know you want me to  
I will be brave  

I will be brave  
Do the things that I'm afraid to do  
I know you want me to  

There are things I wish I didn't know  
I try my best to let them go
