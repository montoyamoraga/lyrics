# Hold You  

Then one night  
It came to me  
In a dream  

You were with me  
All along  
And I could feel  
It with the dawn  

And all of my life  

And all of my life  

I only ever wanted  
To hold you  

Yeah  

I only ever wanted  
To hold you  

Then one night  
It came to me  
In a dream  

You were with me  
All along  
And I could feel  
It with the dawn  

And all of my life  

And all of my life  

And all of my life  

And all of my life  

I only ever wanted  
To hold you  

Yeah  

I only ever wanted  
To hold you  

Then one night  
It came to me  
In a dream  

You were with me  
All along  
And I could feel  
It with the dawn  

And all of my life  

And all of my life  

I only ever wanted  
To hold you  

Yeah  

I only ever wanted  
To hold you  

Then one night  
It came to me  
In a dream  

You were with me  
All along  
And I could feel  
It with the dawn  

And all of my life  

And all of my life  

I only ever wanted  
To hold you  

Yeah  

I only ever wanted  
To hold you
