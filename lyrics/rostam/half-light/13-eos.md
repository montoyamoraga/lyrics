# EOS  

Listen to the crickets at night  
Can you hear that sound  
Dusk and the tide goes out  
Your feet in the sand  

Everyone of us has felt the lights go down  
Everyone of us has felt our heart beat pound  
Everyone of us has felt it on our own  

Lo and behold you were here now you're gone  
Lo and behold you were here now you're gone  

Along the coast we could see time and space  
And across the water it was all emptiness  
But I held you close my cheek pressed up against yours  
And I could feel the hereafter out in front of us both

Along the coast we could see time and space  
And across the water it was all emptiness  
But I held you close my cheek pressed up against yours  
And we could feel the storm gathering in front of us both  

Oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  

Everyone of us has felt the lights go down  
Everyone of us has felt our heart beat pound  

Everyone of us has felt the lights go down  
Everyone of us has felt our heart beat pound  
Everyone of us has felt it on our own  

Lo and behold you were here now you're gone  
Lo and behold you were here now you're gone
