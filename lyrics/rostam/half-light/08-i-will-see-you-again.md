# I Will See You Again  

I believe I will see you again  
At the dawn of creation  
I believe I will see you again  
At the dawn of creation  

With the wolves  
you'd come running at dusk  
In the flickering light  
Or radiation  

And I had seen it  
Written on sidewalks across  
Certain streets and in all  
Of these places  

Was a message some still  
Choose not to read  
In concrete now  
Submerged in the pavement  

So I don't think  
I will see you again  
At dawn at the station
