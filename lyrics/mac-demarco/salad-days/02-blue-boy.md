# Blue Boy  

Blue boy  
Worried about the world's eyes  

Worried  
Every time the sun shines  

Worried  
About his  
Haircut  

Calm down  
Sweetheart  
Grow up  

Blue boy  
Blue boy  
Blue boy  
Blue boy  

Blue boy  
Older than the world knows  

Honey  
That's the way life goes  

No use  
Acting  
So tough  

Calm down  
Sweetheart  
Grow up  

Blue boy  
Blue boy  
Blue boy  
Blue boy  

Hey Tony
