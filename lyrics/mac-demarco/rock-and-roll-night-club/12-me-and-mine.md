# Me and Mine  

Me and mine we'll be alright  
Long as she's standing at my side  
Long as she's loving me  
Mine and me we'll be unified  

Me me me and mine  
Me me me and mine  
Me me me and mine  
Me me me and mine  

Mine and me you and me oh  
Looks like the echo's running low  
Personal hope you weren't home  
Too many lost but not alone  

Me me me and mine  
Me me me and mine  
Me me me and mine  
Me me me and mine
