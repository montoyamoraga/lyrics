# Rock and Roll Night Club  

Cruising in the moonlight  
Heading downtown
Looking for some fast love  
Gotta get down  
Boogie woogie woman  
Looking my way  
So if you want a good time  
You Know just where I stay

At the Rock and Roll Night Club

Meet me on the dance floor  
Let me shake my thing  
We are all just players  
In the rock and roll game  
Boogie woogie woman  
Join me for a dance  
So if you want a good time  
Girl you know my plans
