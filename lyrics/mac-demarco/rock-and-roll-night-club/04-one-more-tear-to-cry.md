# One More Tear To Cry  

Take it on the base  
Take it on the westbound line  
Every time I love  
I always seem to end up crying  

So this is my goodbye  
Wrote it on the way back home  
You say you never loved me  
I wish somehow I could have known  

One more tear to cry  
Here come the lonely nights  
One more tear to cry  
Here come the lonely nights  

Back in Massachusetts  
Walking by the old high school  
It's just the way I left it  
Except this time it's without you  

Sleeping under starlight  
Just can't keep it from my dreams  
My modus operandi  
Is ripping right down it seems

One more tear to cry  
Here come the lonely nights  
One more tear to cry  
Here come the lonely nights  

One more tear to cry  
Here come the lonely nights  
One more tear to cry  
Here come the lonely nights  

One more tear to cry  
Here come the lonely nights  
One more tear to cry  
Here come the lonely nights
