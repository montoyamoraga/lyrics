# Without Me  

Will she  
Love me again tomorrow  
I don't know  
Don't think so  

And that's fine  
Fine by me  
As long as  
Long as I know she's happy  
Happy  

Without me  
Without me  
Without me  
Without me  

Will she  
Find love again tomorrow  
I don't know  
I hope so  

And that's fine  
Fine by me  
As long as  
Long as I know she's happy  
Happy  

Without me  
Without me  
Without me  
Without me
