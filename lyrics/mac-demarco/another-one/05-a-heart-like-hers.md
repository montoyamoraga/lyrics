# A Heart Like Hers  

Done  
Done is all the love  
Love that I had saved for you  


Gone  
Gone with my heart  
Locked inside a cage for you  

And once  
This that has become  
Has become of poor old me  

Tried  
So hard to believe  
In something that will never be never be  

Never believe in a heart like hers again  
Never believe in a heart like hers again  
Never believe in a heart like hers again  
Never believe  

All
All that I could give  
All I had to offer her  

Is gone  
Simply locked away  
No longer there to bother her  

Now look  
Look at what's become  
What's become of poor old me  

Tried  
So hard to believe  
In something that will never be

Never believe in a heart like hers again  
Never believe in a heart like hers again  
Never believe in a heart like hers again  
Never believe  

Never believe in a heart like hers again  
Never believe in a heart like hers again  
Never believe in a heart like hers again  
Never believe
