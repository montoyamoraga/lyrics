# This Old Dog  

Sometimes my love  
May be put on hold  
Sometimes my heart  
May seem awful cold  

These times come  
And these times go  
As long as I live  
All you need to know is  

This old dog ain't about to forget  
All we've had, and all that's next  

Long as my heart's beating in my chest  
This old dog ain't about to forget  

Often a heart  
Tends to change its mind  
A new day decides  
On a new design  

A new day gets set  
On another way  
As long as I live  
All I've got to say is  

This old dog ain't about to forget  
All we've had, and all that's next  

Long as my heart's beating in my chest  
This old dog ain't about to forget
