# Baby You're Out  

Of all the things you wished you'd never done  
I've heard you say that this is number one  
Another life down another road  
Perhaps you're better off to never know  

Don't dream of all the ways things could have been  
Remember all the faces you let in  
Remember all the faces still unseen  
And soon enough you'll see just what I mean  

There's nothing to cry about  
Cause baby baby you're out  

You've always felt it's hard to voice complaints  
But what you voice is what will drive your fate  
And though things never really got that bad  
Dreams of greener grass will drive you mad  

Don't dream of all the ways things could've been  
Remember all the faces you let in  
Remember all the faces still unseen  
And soon enough you'll see just what I mean  

There's nothing to cry about  
Cause baby baby you're out  

Baby you're out  
Baby you're out  
Baby you're out
