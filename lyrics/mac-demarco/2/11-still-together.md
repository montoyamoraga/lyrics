# Still Together  

In time she'll see  
That her and me  
Were meant to be  
Together  

And time will pass  
It may go fast  
But we'll still be  
Together  

And where I go  
She's at my side  
Half of my life  
Together  

It's easy love  
Fits like a glove  
From up above  
Together  

Together  
Together  

I've had my share  
I'ts just not fair  
That we should be  
Together  

But if it's fine  
That I've done my time  
Let's walk the line  
Together  

And when she's low  
I'll always know  
We'll always go  
Together  

It's easy love  
Fits like a glove  
From up above  
Together  

Together  
Together  

Together  
Together
