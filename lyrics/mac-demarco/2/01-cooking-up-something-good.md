# Cooking Up Something Good  

Mommy's in the kitchen cooking up something good  
And daddy's on the sofa pride of the neighborhood  
My brother's in the ballet it seems he's got it set  
And I'll be up at midnight with my cigarette  

Oh when life moves this slowly  
Oh just try and let it go  
Oh when life moves this slowly  
Oh just try and let it go  

Daddy's in the basement cooking up something fine  
While Rick's out on the pavement flipping it for dimes  
If there's anything redeeming I haven't seen it yet  
And I'm still up at midnight chewing nicorette  

Oh when life moves this slowly  
Oh just try and let it go  
Oh when life moves this slowly  
Oh just try and let it go
