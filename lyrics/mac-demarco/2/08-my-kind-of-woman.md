# My Kind of Woman  

Oh baby  
Oh man  
You're making me crazy  
Really driving me mad  

That's all right with me  
It's really no fuss  
As long as you're next to me  
Just the two of us  

You're my my my  
My kind of woman  

My oh my  
What a girl  

You're my my my  
My kind of woman  

And I'm down on my hands and knees  
Begging you please baby  
Show me your world  

Oh brother  
Sweetheart  
I'm feeling so tired  
Really falling apart  

And it just don't make sense to me  
I really don't know  
Why you stick right next to me  
Wherever I go  

You're my my my  
My kind of woman  

My oh my  
What a girl  

You're my my my  
My kind of woman  

And I'm down on my hands and knees  
Begging you please baby  
Show me your world
