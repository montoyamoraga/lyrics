# '79: Rock'n'Roll Will Ruin Your Life

Listen up kid mama said I'm gonna make you scream
When I take you backstage behind that rock'n'roll dream
You think it's all money controlled substances
Premarital sex and bizarre dances
You think it's all noise a vast circus of fun
Well I wouldn't say this to just anyone

Rock'n'roll will ruin your life
Like your old no goodnik dad
Kill your soul and kill your wife
Rock'n'roll will ruin your life
And make you sad
And I mean sad

You laugh now maybe ha but wait till you hear
I've got no use for groupies too shy and too queer
The truth about drugs well I can't afford those
Cause a lot of my money flew up the circus' nose
And all that noise gave me hyperacusis
So turn this record down or it'll happen to you sis

Rock'n'roll will ruin your life
Like your old no goodnik dad
Kill your soul and kill your wife
Rock'n'roll will ruin your life
And make you sad
And I mean sad

Rock'n'roll will ruin your life
Like your old no goodnik dad
Kill your soul and kill your wife
Rock'n'roll will ruin your life
And make you sad
