# '70: They're Killing Children Over There

So we went to see the Jefferson Airplane
Odetta was the opening act
Grace Slick was young and angry
She said my fellow freaks it's a fact

They're killing children over there
They're killing children over there
I know we're not supposed to care
But they're still killing children over there

Back then I was even younger than Grace Slick
Even for my age I was small
I thought she meant a massacre
Was taking place inside that hall

She said they're killing children over there
They're killing children over there
I know we're not supposed to care
But they're still killing children over there

Now that everyone is fat and complacent
I haven't heard a protest in years
We just keep paying our taxes
The taxes keep turning the gears

They're killing children over there
They're killing children over there
I know we're not supposed to care
But they're still killing children over there
