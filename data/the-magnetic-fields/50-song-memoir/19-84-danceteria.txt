# '84: Danceteria!

We don't always go to school
But we always go to Danceteria
There is always something school
Happening somewhere in Danceteria
Danceteria

Classes at seven thirty AM
Sometimes we stay up and go to them
This is more important
You'll get educated at Danceteria
Danceteria

I always get in for free
I only paid once at Danceteria
Lydia Mark Nick and Foetus
Are on tonight at Danceteria
Danceteria

Biding time until Save the Robots
Let's arrange our hair like Rorschach blots
Maybe we can be anything
Or anyone at Danceteria
Danceteria

I invented the sugar
And lettuce sandwich at Dancenteria
Lost my hearingwhen Einsturzende
Neubaten played Danceteria
Danceteria

All six nights a week unfailingly
Seeing the Shirelles or ESG
Every day's a total blur
When you spend the night at Danceteria
Danceteria

Culture is not for the faint of heart
Poetry music performance art
Everything is theater
And everyone's on stage at Danceteria
