# '95: A Serious Mistake

Although we know that someone's heart will break
Hey Jake let's make a serious mistake
And while we smile look forward to heartache
Let's undertake a serious mistake

Which one of us will it be
To end this tale of misery
Wen will this comedy turn sour
A year a month a week an hour

All we can be sure of is it will
All good things come to bad ends
But still

Although we know that someone's heart will break
Hey Jake let's make a serious mistake
And while we smile look forward to heartache
Let's undertake a serious mistake

Although we know that someone's heart will break
Hey Jake let's make a serious mistake
And while we smile look forward to heartache
Let's undertake a serious mistake
