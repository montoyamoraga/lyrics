# '78: The Blizzard of '78

One ten year old was found after three weeks
In a snowdrift ten feet from his door
Some fell asleep in their cars and awakened no more

Twenty-five people died shoveling snow
Have that done by somebody you hate
A hundred and sixty-six looters arrested but wait

I spent the blizzard of seventy-eight
On a commune in Northern Vermont
With all the Isaac Asimov anybody could want

Music was very much not allowed
So we said hey kids let's start a band
Proof that Ganesh loves us
There was no tape deck at hand

The first band I'd had was called One and a Half
We were a duo technically
So if Tonto's Expanding Head Bang was a band
So were we

I spent the blizzard of seventy-eight
On a commune in Northern Vermont
With all the Ursula Le Guin anybody could want

I played guitar Chris played tin cans
Caroline played tambourine
Chris was eleven Caroline twelve I thirteen

We called ourselves the Black Widows
We weren't the last nor the first
But we were almost certainly by far the worst

We made the Cramps sound orchestral
That's an achievement I guess
As for rehearsal
We made the Shaggs sound like Yes

I spent the blizzard of seventy-eight
On a commune in Northern Vermont
With all the Roger Zelazny anybody could want

It was hell
