# '96: I'm Sad!

I'm sad
You made me sad
You're bad
Oh the pain

A tad
More pain and I'd go
Insane and I'd go
Unclad
In the rain

You'd like that wouldn't you
You like to make me blue

Egad
I never had
A dad
Paid my dues

Poor lad
Pitiful orphans
With no endorphins
Wail trad
Blues

Blue blues
Blue blue blues

I'm sad
You made me sad
I'm glad
That you're gone
You cad
