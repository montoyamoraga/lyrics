# '01: Have You Seen it in the Snow?

They say the city is dirty and gray
But I think it's pretty on a summer day
And on rainy nights
When the streets smudge the lights
It's beautiful you know

But have you seen it in the snow
When every light has a halo
When it snows all night
And the world glows white
In the morning light
Oh have you seen it in the snow

They'll tell you this town is an ugly thing
It's all falling down and rebuilding
Neither stars nor sun
And I've never seen one rainbow
For rainbows go to Idaho

But have you seen it in the snow
When every light has a halo
When it snows all night
And the world glows white
In the morning light
Oh have you seen it in the snow
