# '09: Till You Come Back To Me

When you come back to me
I will be at the bar
Drinking I will be thoroughly
Til you come back to me
If you come back to me

Who did you leave me for
Can't wait to find out who you like more
Who has been sniffing round your back door
You dirty lil

When you come back to me
Please don't be overlong
I'll be singing this drinking song
Til you come back to me
If you come back to me

Where did you sleep last night
You tried to reach me
I'm sure you're right
Irving and I caught an early flight
We're home where are you

You've been mean lately
Endlessly critical
I'll play pinball at the Eagle
Til you come back to me
If you come back to me
At all
