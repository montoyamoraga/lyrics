# '05: Never Again

Never again down this cobblestone lane
We'll walk in the rain
Just having a day

Never when newspaper pages blow by
We'll watch as they fly
And sing what they say

I guess there'll be other fish in the sea
But I don't want fishes and you don't want me

Never again will we walk in the snow
With nowhere to go
For ten centuries

Lately I'm thinking of packing it in
And going to Berlin
Or Los Angeles

I wish I had some place better to go
But lately I can't take New York in the snow

I'm sorry I wasted your summer
I shouldn't have stolen your light
Instead of me gawking
I should've kept walking
Everything would be alright

Never again I will look in your eyes
And see your surprise
At not being dead

Forever then I won't know what to do
With these houses for you
I've built in my head

I wish I had something better to do
But even my own clothes remind me of you
