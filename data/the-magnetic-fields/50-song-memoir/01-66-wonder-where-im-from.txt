# '66: Wonder Where I'm From

In Saint Thomas barefoot beatniks bonk
On a boat afloat in rum
Is it there I'm from
I wonder where I'm from

Up in Yonkers two blocks from the Bronx
Baby born about as big as your thumb
Is it there I'm from
I wonder where I'm from

Never stayed in any one place two years
I was made in America three cheers
Until

Baden-Baden in the BRD
Lederhosen on my baby bum
Is it there I'm from
I wonder where I'm from

Rarely stayed in one place more than a year
I was made in the northern hemisphere
Um

All the seashells tossed up on the shore
Contain the oceanic hum
They know where they're from
I wonder where I'm from
I wonder where I'm from
