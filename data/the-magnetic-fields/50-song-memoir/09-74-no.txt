# '74: No

Is there a man in heaven looking out for you
Is there a place dead loved ones go
Is there a source of wisdom that will see you through
Will there be peace in our time
No

We knew Karmu a faith healer the black Christ he said
Laying his hands on high and low
Did he cure colds and cancer and bring back the dead
Did he refuse donations
No

My friend Scott says there's flying saucers
Hiding inside our hollow moon
Our hollow moon
And then there's Karl card-carrying communist
Cause revolution's coming soon
It's coming soon

And Carolyn believes in fairies
And Gabrielle believes in ghosts
Yeshe believes in reincarnation
We'll meet again
And David in heavenly hosts
Heavenly hosts

My mother believes that this physical universe
Is a big holographic show
And she says someday science'll catch up with her
Has she a shred of evidence
No
