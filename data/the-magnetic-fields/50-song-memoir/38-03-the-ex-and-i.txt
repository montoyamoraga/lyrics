# '03: The Ex and I

The ex and I
We had a one night stand
It didn't go as planned
And things got out of hand

And the ex
And I are having sex
At first it was perplexing
But now I think it's grand

So
He used to be my beau
About eight years ago
And now my tale of woe woe woe

Wends
With us as more than friends
Now every evening ends
With XXX ex sex
