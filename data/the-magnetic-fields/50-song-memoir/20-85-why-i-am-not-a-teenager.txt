# '85: Why I Am Not a Teenager

You work like a robot
Making diddly squat
This is why I am not a teenager
They all talk down to you
Like they know what to do
Are they trying to screw up your life
Since they already blew their own

But when I grow up
I'm going to run
My own planetarium
I'll make the shows
All on my down
The world will flock to see 'em

All that money they've got
They don't give you a jot
This is why I am not a teenager
When you never get paid
And you never get laid
And you're full of these stupid hormones
And just then they come out with AIDS

But when I grow up
I'm going to be
And underground film maker
I'll have my own
Backlot somewhere
On my own half an acre

So they piss on your dreams
Then they muzzle your screams
This is why I am not a teenager
Making ice cream on trucks
Shoveling horse products
Washing dishes and making popcorn
Toilets oh the indignity

Piss on your dreams
Muzzle your screams
Why I am not a teenager
Piss on your dreams
Muzzle your screams

Piss on your dreams
Muzzle your screams
Why I am not a teenager
Piss on your dreams
Muzzle your screams
