# '07: In the Snow White Cottages

In the Snow White Cottages
As cute as LA gets
In the Norman Tudor
Two doors from the Raveonettes

In the Snow White Cottages
Each day looks like a myth
In the house once occupied
By singer Elliott Smith
By poor dear Elliott Smith

While there we made a documentary
Concerning my friend Claudia and me
A movie you did not want to be in

In the Snow White Cottages
It's always fourteen ten
Walt Disney started down the block
The artists lived here then
They lived here even then

In the Snow White Cottages
I lived just like a prince
It's lovely in Mulholland Drive
And hadn't changed much since
And hasn't changed much since
