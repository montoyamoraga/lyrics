# '89: The 1989 Musical Marching Zoo

Anonymous figures with animal heads
Are they human or are they quadrupeds
Are they psychotics who have gone off their meds and away

The nineteen eighty-nine musical marching zoo
Are coming to play
Inside of your mind

The nineteen eighty-nine musical marching zoo
Are coming to stay
Don't be left behind

And this is the band that I wanted to be
No names and faces and no history
Particularly no pictures of me

The nineteen eighty-nine musical marching zoo
Are coming to play
Inside of your mind

The nineteen eighty-nine musical marching zoo
Are coming to stay
Don't be left behind

If only musicians were invisible
Or like the Residents identical
Sod MTV show me a tractor pull
And the nineteen eighty-nine musical marching zoo
