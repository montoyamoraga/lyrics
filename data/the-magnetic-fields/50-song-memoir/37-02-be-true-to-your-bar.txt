# '02: Be True to Your Bar

Sitting in bars and cafés
Writing songs about songs
And plays within plays
But how rarely we dare
To write something that says
Anything about bars and cafés

Be true to your bar
And don't let it down
Or else it may not always be around

Be true to your friends
And let your friends know
Without your bar you'd have no place to go

You can't drink tea all day long
You'll have two heart attacks
Before you write the third the song
And how barely you'll care
If the rhythm's all wrong
Drinking Irish Breakfast all day long

Eight hours is all you can take
Of tea at Saint Dymphna's
Until your hands shake
Then repair to your lair
For booze and beefcake
Eight more hours til you can't stay awake

Be true to your bar
And don't let it down
Or else it may not always be around

Be true to your friends
And let your friends know
Without your bar you'd have no place to go

Be true to your bar
And don't let it down
Or else it may not always be around

Be true to your friends
And let your friends know
Without your bar you'd have no place to go

Be true to your bar
