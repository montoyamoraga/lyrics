# '13: Big Enough for Both of Us

This thing is big enough for both of us
It throbs with enough for two
Bet on the seasons to keep changing
Just like I keep on loving you

Maybe you'd learn to like just being loved
Even learn to love me in some way
This heart is big enough for both of us
But you're three thousand miles away

Three thousand miles away
Three thousand miles away

There's something big enough for both of us
It's part of my anatomy
You know I'd love to give it all to you
And you can have it all for free

First time I saw you I could feel a stir
Down in my special body part
I would like you to take it in your hand
But please be careful it's my heart

Three thousand miles away
Three thousand miles away
Three thousand miles away

This thing is big enough for both of us
It throbs with love enough for two
Bet on the seasons to keep changing
Just like I keep on loving you
