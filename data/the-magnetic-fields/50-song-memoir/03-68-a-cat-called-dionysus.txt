# '68: A Cat Called Dionysus

We had a cat called Dionysus
Every day another crisis
I used to keep him in my box
Where I kept all my toys and blocks

He hated me
But I loved him

Whenever Dionysus saw me
He'd arch his back and hiss and claw me
As soon as he could he got loose
Across the roofs of Syracuse

Away from me
But I loved him

I kept him in the little chest
Where I was keeping all the rest

He hated me
Cause I loved him
