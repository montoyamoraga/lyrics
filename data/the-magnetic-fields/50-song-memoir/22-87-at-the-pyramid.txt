# '87: At the Pyramid

I saw you at the Pyramid
Disco all around you
You danced into my dream world

Bleach blond with caterpillar eyes
Rugby shirt like a bumble bee
A shy-boy smile dimples for days
Destined never to notice me

I saw you at the Pyramid
Disco all around you
You danced into my dream world

It's true there have been other guys
But what's your name guess I'll never know
Your face was burned into my eyes
By strobe lights half my light ago

I saw you at the Pyramid
Disco all around you
You danced into my dream world
