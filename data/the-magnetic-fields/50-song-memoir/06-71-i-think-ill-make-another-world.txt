# '71: I Think I'll Make Another World

I think I'll make another world
And fill it with whatever I want
No one can say I can or can't
I can see it now

I think I'll make another world
It may not start out very large
But no one else will be in charge
I can see it now
I can see it now

And we will dance you and I
Like we were very small
Through the air through the night
And through the marble hall
No one can say that's all wrong
Cause I'll say get out of my song

Cause I can see another world
And I can make it with my hands
Who cares if no one understands
I can see it now
I can see it now

The little stuff I've dreamed about
Since I was just a zygote
The headless caryatid
With her plucky seeing eye goat
No one can say that's all wrong
Cause I can say hey it's my song

And I can see another world
And I can make it with my hands
Who cares if no one understands
I can see it now

I can see it growing
And moving by itself
And talking in its own way
It's realer than the old one
