# '00: Ghosts of the Marathon Dancers

The ghosts of the marathon dancers
In an abandoned dancehall
Go whirling around in the eddies of dust
When the wind comes in through a chink in the wall

All the music and the dancers are gone
But the dance goes on
They all danced til some long ago dawn
But the dance goes on

In the cellars of dead Rockefellers
Hallways and subways and vaults
Go twisting and turning for mile after mile
In a glorious Gilded Age waltz

All the music and the dancers are gone
But the dance goes on
They all danced til some long ago dawn
But the dance goes on

And I wrote the above in this ghost town
For a movie that wasn't to be
An adaptation of a French musical
Produced by Ted Hope directed by Ang Lee

All the rights and the money are gone
But the song goes on
Like most movies it'll never be done
But the song goes on
