# '10: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea

Twenty thousand leagues under the sea
Hand in hand we will go
And as long as you there with me
That's all I need to know

The bibelots and bric a brac in our big B and B
The strangely flavored ice creams
Cream for you sorbet for me
My science fiction score for a nineteen sixteen movie

Twenty thousand leagues under the sea
Hand in hand we will go
And as long as you there with me
That's all I need to know

The panoramic San Francisco view from the sun deck
Your sleepy tongue inside my ear
Your warm breath on my neck
The daddy of all submarines
The peak of steampunk tech

Twenty thousand leagues under the sea
Hand in hand we will go
And as long as you there with me
That's all I need to know
