# '08: Surfin'

Surfin'
I don't wanna go surfing
Why would surfing be fun

Surfin'
What's the purpose of surfing
I believe there is none

Surfin'
Boring people go surfing
In those horrible shorts

Surfin'
How moronic is surfing
It's the dumbest of sports

Surfin'
Crowds are ruining surfing
Which is pointless and dull

Surfin'
Was transgressive and cool but
Now the oceans are full
