# '82: Happy Beeping

My mother found another jerk
A drummer jazz who liked to smirk
At those who lacked his special skills
Keeping loose time with little fills

One morn I found my counterpoint
Homework torn up tacked to my door
Like Luther's ninety-five theses
A note explained what this was for

Happy beeping it said
Happy beeping it read
The creep had come-a-creeping
Happy beeping

He clearly hated Neu! and Can
Cluster and Eno and Japan
Though to be fair he liked my books
He took my Richard Brautigan

Happy beeping it said
Happy beeping it read
In the night while I was sleeping
Happy beeping

Happy beeping it said
Happy beeping it read
In the night while I was sleeping
Happy beeping
