# '76: Hustle 76

Some people don't know how to dance
It's easy you just move your hips
Now as a chorus line advance
Tomorrow we'll do tango dips
You see darlings the whole world round
We've all gone wild for this new sound

Hustle seventy-six
Everybody dance now
You've got to dance now

Hustle seventy-six
Ooh don't make romance now
Please no romance now

Hustle seventy-six
Everybody dance your life away

They sold a record on TV
Big melodies with simple beats
Dance music for the AM dial
Lyrics alas not for aesthetes
What can I tell you I was ten
I should have been by bed by then
I order

Hustle seventy-six
Everybody dance now
You've got to dance now

Hustle seventy-six
Ooh don't make romance now
Please no romance now

Hustle seventy-six
Everybody dance your life away

Hustle seventy-six
Everybody dance now
You've got to dance now

Hustle seventy-six
Ooh don't make romance now
Please no romance now

Hustle seventy-six
Everybody dance your life away

Hustle seventy-six
Everybody dance your life away
