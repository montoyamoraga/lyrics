# '80: London by Jetpack

London by jetpack
It can be done
What we spend on fuel
We'll make in film

From the ICA
To Abbey Road in seconds
On high rooftops
We'll dance the twist

I spent August in London when
The New Romantics reigned
And though I was oblivious then
My love has never waned
My roots are New Romantic as
Some critics have complained

London by jetpack
My verse novel
When teenagers fly
They change the sky

It's not the going up
It's not the going down
It's the zooming around
The speed the sex

When I am monarch of the world
Weighed down by matters weighty
I'll live in London once more
And decree it's nineteen eighty
That all may dress as Pierrots
And pirates like their king
And all will have jetpacks
From club to club we'll go zooming

At the club with no name
We'll dance again
Vivienne Westwood
Will be my queen
There will be no army
Only the Blitz

It's not the going up
It's not the coming down
London by jetpack
I'll write you yet
