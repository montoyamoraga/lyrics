# '99: Fathers in the Clouds

I've had no need for fathers
Or fathers in the clouds
Out of the sky
There comes this guy
Saying I I I

What does one say
Where have you been all this time
Where's my back pay
Was your Broadway play sublime

There is a lie on my birth certificate
And the other guy would like me to change it
I've met each of them twice

Here's an odd thing
The correspondence is queer
We've both written songs
Danced to by Richard Gere

I have no need for fathers
Or fathers in the clouds
Saying I I I
