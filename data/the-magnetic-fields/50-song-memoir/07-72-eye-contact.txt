# '72: Eye Contact

Eye contact
Must we make eye contact
Must we always react
Through frowns and smiles

Let's make a pact
When we must interact
Facing front would distract
From our profiles
Lovely profiles

Eye contact
How I hate eye contact
Having to stare
Exactly in fact where

Pretend to care
Where you happen to stare
Break contact if you dare
Ha ha I win
Ha ha I win

Eye contact
For the autodidact
Ever and always smacked
Of smarmy charm

Call me barmy
Must we all be warm
Must all warmth take the form
Of eye contact
Contact my eye
