# '69: Judy Garland

The first brick the drag king threw
To draw blood from the boys in blue
Said here lies Judy Garland on it

It flew through historic air
Even Taylor Mead was there
And Allen Ginsberg wrote a sonnet

One day after the funeral
Stones flew over the Stonewall
Judy Garland

Halfway through her tell-all memoirs
Who flew up into the stars
Judy Garland
Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free

We tried to drive to Woodstock but
Our little blue bug couldn't cut
Through that last hundred miles of traffic

Love still dared not to speak
In l'année érotique
Je t'aime was banned as pornographic

So put those feather boas on
Drink too much wine
And celebrate the revolution
Of sixty-nine

Cause life-sized life never was enough
Who called reality's bluff
Judy Garland

Patron saint or victim of love
Let's try none of the above
Judy Garland
Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free

Some say it's coincidence
No relation
As if she didn't die for us
Her love nation

Halfway through nineteen sixty-nine
Who joined heaven's conga line
Judy Garland

Sick and tired of being alive
She flew back to Rigel Five
Judy Garland
Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free
So be free with me
Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free
Judy Garland set us free
So be free with me
