# '83: Foxx and I

Foxx and I
Have the Roland TB-303
I should think it will be easy
Miming on Top of the Pops

Foxx and I
Liberated from emotions
Exploring other oceans
What use have we for hell

Anyone can change into a machine
Girl or white black or boy
Dull or very strange into a machine
Come with me

Foxx and I
Making pictures of tomorrow's sun
Just to prove that there is one
The future says hello

There is sometimes an interlude
Bucolic and serene
Beneath a sky non-repro blue
And grass of green screen green
I'll zoom by on my jetpack
I can't wait to be sixteen
I can't wait to be sixteen

Foxx and I
Decades later at my DJ night
Our conversation takes flight
Kraftwerk and clavichords

Foxx and I
Backstage at Cadogan Hall
Not like rockstars at all
Why would we want to be

Anyone can change into a machine
Girl or white black or boy
Dull or very strange into a machine
Come with me

Anyone can change into a machine
Girl or white black or boy
Dull or very strange into a machine
Come with me
