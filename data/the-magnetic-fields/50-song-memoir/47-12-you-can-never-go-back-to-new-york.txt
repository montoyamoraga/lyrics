# '12: You Can Never Go Back to New York

You can never go back to New York
Cause it changes as quick as the weather
Everyone sing it together
You can never go back to New York

You can go back to Banff or Big Bear
And whatever you loved will still be there
But if you don't plan to ski there
You can never go back to New York

You can go out of town for a week
And they move it all round to confuse you
Adding new things to amuse you
Just in case you come back to New York

I was only away for six years
And you'd think I'd arrived from Wisconsin
Lots of fresh meat for romancing
Woof it's fun to go back to New York

You can never go back to New York
Anyway dear why would you want to
There's a new New York to move on to
Who would ever go back to New York

You can never go back to New York
Cause it changes as quick as the weather
Everyone sing it together
You can never go back to New York

You can go back to Banff or Big Bear
And whatever you loved will still be there
But if you don't plan to ski there
You can never go back to New York
