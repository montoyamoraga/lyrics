# '04: Cold-Blooded Man

You need someone thoroughly sadistic
With a less appealing face and form
Someone who comes home and goes ballistic

You need a cold-blooded man
In a serial killer van
You need a cold-blooded man to keep you warm

Someone unfashionably fascistic
Randomly selected from the dorm
One without one good characteristic

You need a cold-blooded man
I should have known when we began
You need a cold-blooded man to keep you warm

One who likes his girlfriends masochistic
Too stupid to come in from the storm
Someone who could make you a statistic

You need a cold-blooded man
And then you'll need a CAT scan
You need a cold-blooded man to keep you warm

You need a cold-blooded man
A dull and cruel also ran
You need a cold-blooded man to keep you warm
