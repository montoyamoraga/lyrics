# '11: Stupid Tears

I hate you you stupid tears
I mean come on seven years
You'd think I'd be blind by now

Fall from my face
To stain this pillowcase no more
This means war

How long like a man possessed
Must I keen and beat my breast
Time to forget yes but how

Ooze not from me
Counting out misery and pain
It's not sane

I hate you you stupid tears
Your vast kitschy chandeliers
Completely obscure the sky

I hate you
I hate you
I hate you
