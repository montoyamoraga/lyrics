# '94: Haven't Got a Penny

I haven't got a penny to my name
And I'm all alone in this city
Cause I haven't got a penny to my name
I could sell myself if I was pretty

I'll die alone
No one will mourn
I wish I'd known
And not been born

Cause I haven't got a penny to my name
And I've alienated everybody
And I'll never have a penny to my name
I'm a thirty yeard old fuddy duddy

When I was eight
My mom displayed
Our only dollar
We had it made
Now I haven't got a penny to my name

I wish I wish
I'd not been born

I wish I wish
I'd not been born

I wish I wish
I'd not been born

I wish I wish
I'd not been born

I wish I wish
I'd not been born

I wish I wish
I'd not been born

I wish I wish
I'd not been born

I wish I wish
I'd not been born

I wish I wish
I'd not been born
