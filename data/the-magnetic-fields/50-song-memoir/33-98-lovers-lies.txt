# '98: Lovers' Lies

Lovers' lies lovers' lies
They should make us roll our eyes
Oh if only we were wise
We'd be lonelier and wise

Lovers' words lovers' words
They are strictly for the birds
A strong sense of the absurd's
No defense from lover's words

Every word you say
Every word you sigh
Every word a lie

Every word you crow
Every word you cry
Every word a lie

Lovers' truth lovers' truth
Heard in every buddy booth
When we're longer in the tooth
Mothers' milk is lovers' truth

Lovers' lies lovers' lies
They are only lullabies
Please remind me to devise
A sound to drown out lovers' lies
