# '14: I Wish I Had Pictures

I wish I had pictures of every old day
Cause all these old memories are fading away
There used to be pictures but they faded too
Or got lost in the hubbub or I'd show them to you

Of all my old lovers folks I used to know
And those I still care for who died long ago
The glamorous cities each cute little town
The trees turning purple and yellow and brown

If I were an artist with charcoal and pad
I'd make my own pictures of each day I've had
If I were a poet I'd know the right word
I'd make it all pretty and grand and absurd
If I were an actor with just a wisecrack
Or some little gesture I'd bring it all back

But I'm just a singer it's only a song
The things I remember are probably wrong
I wish I had pictures of every old day
Cause all these old memories are fading away
All these old memories are fading away
All these old memories are fading away
All these old memories are fading away
