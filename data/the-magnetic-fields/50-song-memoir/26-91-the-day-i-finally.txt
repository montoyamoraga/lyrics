# '91: The Day I Finally...

The day I finally snap
Everybody will clap
They'll be lining up for miles
For me to slay them in the aisles
And it won't be long now
No no no it won't be long now
Til it comes to a stop

The day I finally croak
Bet my life is a joke
Everybody will laugh
Right off the end of the graph
And they won't be wrong now
No no no they won't be wrong now

They day I finally
Everybody will
They'll be lining up for miles
For me to slay them in the aisles
And it won't be long now
No no no it won't be long now
Til it comes to a stop

They day I finally
Because my life is a
There was a young woman from Enus
Who came to our party as Venus
We told her how rude
It was to come there quite nude
And we brought her a leaf from the greenhouse

Everybody will ha ha ha ha ha
