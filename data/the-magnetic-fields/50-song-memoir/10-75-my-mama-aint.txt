# '75: My Mama Ain't

My mama ain't no madam
Massage is all they do
Law troubles sure she's had 'em
Been stopped for speeding too

She says she ain't no hippy
I guess beatnik's the word
She says the world is trippy
Enough drugs are absurd

She was an English teacher
Her master's was in ed
But she taught Harriet Beecher
Stowe and got fired

My mama ain't no loony
But she likes joining cults
She could've been a moonie
With similar results

She gave away her monies
And all our furnishings
To benefit the bunnies
And all sentient beings

She flirted once with yoga
We stayed on an ashram
The guru wore a toga in Saratoga
We chanted bhaja govindam

My mama ain't no nudist
Except around the pool
She's a Tibetan Buddhist
Like Catholic only cool

Now mama's going vendetta
A similar belief
Her friends look more like Santa
And much less like Gurjieff

My mom's a little flaky
Believes in everything
From auras to zen reiki
Except crystal healing

She draws the line
At crystal healing
