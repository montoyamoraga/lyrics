# Either You Don't Love Me Or I Don't Love You

Lost roads and towns
Of which nobody's found the name
All the children drowned
And there's no one around to blame

Lost roads and towns
Left to wilder in seed and snow
As the sun goes down
That's where I'd like to go

Every time you feel wonderful baby I feel bad
Either you don't love me or I don't love you oh yeah
When you remind me of all the good times I feel sad
Either you don't love me or I don't love you oh yeah

You and me in the waiting room
Of a disused railroad station
Scavenging for a few antiques
We'll make a fortune just have patience
If we find an old signal box
You can write your dissertation

Every time you feel wonderful baby I feel bad
Either you don't love me or I don't love you oh yeah
When you remind me of all the good times I feel sad
Either you don't love me or I don't love you oh yeah
