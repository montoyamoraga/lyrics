# Young And Insane  

In this town  
There is nothing at all  
But a brown  
School and a dead shopping mall  
The record store  
Is execrable  
We sit around  
Blowing bubbles  

Cause we're young and insane  
And we're running away for the summer  
We're deprived and depraved  
And we won't get away with it young and insane  

When you're free  
In an antique car  
For a week  
You will know who you are  
In uninhabitable  
We go out  
To jump in puddles  

Cause we're young and insane  
And we're running away for the summer  
We're deprived and depraved  
And we won't get away with it young and insane
