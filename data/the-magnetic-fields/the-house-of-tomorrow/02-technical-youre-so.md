# Technical (You're So)  

You have prosthetic wings  
You drive a surveillance van  
You're always doing seven things  
You write the code for brain implants  

There are no papers on you  
The law doesn't cover what you do  
You and your think tank entourage  
Are all counterculture demigods  

You're so technical  
You go hacking around the world  
You're so technical baby  
Are you a boy or a girl  

You have some extra limbs  
You look like a Swiss army knife with wings  
Dance like a Hindu deity  
Best friends with Timothy Leary  

You're so technical  
You go hacking around the world  
You're so technical baby  
Are you a boy or a girl  

You're a libertarian  
The death of the left was you  
You look like Herbert von Karajan  
You live underneath the zoo  

You're so technical  
You go hacking around the world  
You're so technical baby  
Are you a boy or a girl
