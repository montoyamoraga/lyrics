# Love Goes Home To Paris In The Spring  

I'm counting the habits you made me break  
I'm counting the drugs you won't let me take  
I'm counting my friends you won't let me see  

I've had enough  
You never give me anything  
Don't you know love  
Goes home to Paris in the spring  

Adding up the hours I've waited for you  
I'm counting the calls that never came through  
I'm counting my friends you melted away  
I'm counting the times you were king for a day  

I've had enough  
You never give me anything  
Don't you know love  
Goes home to Paris in the spring
