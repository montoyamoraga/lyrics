# Fear of Trains  

It was the army train that took her daddy from her  
It was the bible train that took her momma too  
And that high loud whistle made her horse run away  
But the straw that broke the camel's back was you  

It was the government train that took away her childhood  
It was the KKK that took away her past  
It was the white man's will that hers be broken  
But that barefoot girl could run too fast  

Because the world's too cold for a girl like that  
With a Blackfoot soul and a cowboy hat  
Everything she loved went down the dragon track  
She had a fear of trains  

In the beet fields of Montana  
She's always coming on dead rails  
To break the plow and whisper honey  
Bound to live is is bound to fail  

And in a park in San Francisco  
Her momma shrieks about the lord  
And down the dead rails there's an echo  
The wind is whistling all-aboard  

Because the world's too cold for a girl like that  
With a Blackfoot soul and a cowboy hat  
Everything she loved went down the dragon track  
She had a fear of trains  

It was the wagon train that took away her country  
It was the oil train that took away her land  
And she could have been the belle of the ponderosa  
But that was not the fat man's plan  

Because the world's too cold for a girl like that  
With a Blackfoot soul and a cowboy hat  
Everything she loved went down the dragon track  
She had a fear of trains  
She had a fear of trains
