# I Have the Moon

Well we have walked in ancient times
And we've been burned for many crimes
We have ended many lives
But we never really died

You have the sun I have the moon

You have to fly around the world all day
To keep the sun upon your face
I'd like to come and comfort you
But I'd be blinded by the blue

You have the sun I have the moon

You're bound to die under the sun
And I'll be doomed to carry on
You have become like other men
But let me kiss you once again

You have the sun I have the moon
