# Two Characters in Search of a Country Song  

You were just like me you were one big bruise  
In the game of life we were playing to lose  
You were Jesse James I was William Tell  
You were Daniel Webster I was the devil himself  

Two characters in search of a country song  
Just make-believe but so in love  
Two characters been listening all night long  
For voices from Nashville above  

Hell on eighteen wheels at a hundred per  
We went crashing through the Jersey barrier  
But the road went on over dale and hill  
You were Calamity Jane and I was Wild Bill  

Two characters in search of a country song  
Just make-believe but so in love  
Two characters been listening all night long  
For voices from Nashville above  

Two characters in search of a country song  
Just make-believe but so in love  
Two characters been listening all night long  
For voices from Nashville above
