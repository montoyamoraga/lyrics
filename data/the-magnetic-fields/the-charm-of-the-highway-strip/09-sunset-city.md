# Sunset City  

Well I don't care what people say  
Life is too short to hang around  
So I stay so long in a place  
And then move on to the next town  

Oh Sunset City I've got to see the world  
Don't hold me too tightly don't whisper my name  
Sad-eyed baby I'm not that kind of girl  
When the dice stop rolling there's no more to the game  
When the time comes to say goodbye  

And in the morning I'll be gone  
For other towns and other lives  
I'll catch the first train bag in hand  
And I won't miss you and you won't cry  

Oh Sunset City I've got to see the world  
Don't hold me too tightly don't whisper my name  
Sad-eyed baby I'm not that kind of girl  
When the dice stop rolling there's no more to the game  
When the time comes to say goodbye  

Oh Sunset City I've got to see the world  
Don't hold me too tightly don't whisper my name  
Sad-eyed baby I'm not that kind of girl  
When the dice stop rolling there's no more to the game  
When the time comes to say goodbye
