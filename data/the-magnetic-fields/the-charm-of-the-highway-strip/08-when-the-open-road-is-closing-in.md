# When the Open Road Is Closing In  

Time measured in dotted yellow lines has passed you by  
And I never said an honest thing to you in all my life  
Hard times go slowly and the good times never come  
The world is a motor in an Iowa highway slum  

When the open road is closing in  
And you can't say where it ends and you begin  
When every truckstop dive's another five years off your life  
When the open road is closing in  
And the dotted yellow lines begin to spin  
When the sky begins to fall on everything you like at all  
You won't be coming home again  

Ciao you keep on drowning in the roads between the towns  
Now I have been closing all the shutters in the house  
Well I know you'll be back when every tree is turning brown  
You'll find the house is empty and the swingset's fallen down  

When the open road is closing in  
And you can't say where it ends and you begin  
When every truckstop dive's another five years off your life  
When the open road is closing in  
And the dotted yellow lines begin to spin  
When the sky begins to fall on everything you like at all  
You won't be coming home again
