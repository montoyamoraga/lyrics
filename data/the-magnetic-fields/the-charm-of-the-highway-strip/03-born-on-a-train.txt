# Born on a Train

Some roads are only seen at night
Ghost roads nothing but neon signs
But some nights the neon gas gets free
And turns into walking dead like me

And I've been making promises I know I'll never keep
One of these days I'm gonna leave you in your sleep
I'll have to go when the whistle blows 
The whistle knows my name
Baby I was born on a train

Well I know that you were never young
And I know you probably won't get old
But honey nobody's gonna hurt you anymore
And nobody's gonna make you want to die

And I've been making promises I know I'll never keep
One of these days I'm gonna leave you in your sleep
I'll have to go when the whistle blows 
The whistle knows my name
Baby I was born on a train

I'll go some cold and grey morning
And you won't remember anything
Well some people don't believe in dying
But some of us don't believe in life

And I've been making promises I know I'll never keep
One of these days I'm gonna leave you in your sleep
I'll have to go when the whistle blows 
The whistle knows my name
Baby I was born on a train
Baby I was born on a train
