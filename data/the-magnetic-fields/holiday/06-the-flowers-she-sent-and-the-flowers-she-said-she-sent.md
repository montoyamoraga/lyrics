# The Flowers She Sent and the Flowers She Said She Sent  

I saw you standing at the airport  
With your chihuahua in your hand  
Crying on the moving sidewalk  
On your way to Disneyland  

And the flowers she sent  
And the flowers she said she sent  
Are all equally dead  
You don't care anymore what she said  

And the books she read  
And the books that she said she read  
Are all spread on the floor  
You don't get out of bed anymore  

I saw you closing your antique shop  
With a boa around your throat  
And you trembled like an ostrich  
In your ostrich feather coat  

And the flowers she sent  
And the flowers she said she sent  
Are all equally dead  
You don't care anymore what she said  

And the books she read  
And the books that she said she read  
Are all spread on the floor  
You don't get out of bed anymore
