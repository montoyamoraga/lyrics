# Deep Sea Diving Suit  

You didn't have to say that I'm no good cause I know  
There's no point pointing pistols at me now I'll just go  
I never should have asked you to be kind but I'm slow  

And I'm sorry but how can I get to you  
Stuck in my fifty pound lead boots  
Stuck in my deep sea diving suit  

I never thought you'd turn on me cause you're my best friend  
You say I never offered you a thing in the end  
And now you wouldn't trust me with a grain of sand  

And I'm sorry but how can I get to you  
Stuck in my fifty pound lead boots  
Stuck in my deep sea diving suit  

And I'm sorry but how can I get to you  
Stuck in my fifty pound lead boots  
Stuck in my deep sea diving suit
