# Sad Little Moon

The saddest brown eyes
I'll ever know
You gave up crying
So long ago

But come outside
And watch the snow
Softly falling

Sad little moon in the big black sky
All alone hang your head and cry
Sad little moon in the timeless night
You may sleep but you will never die

You didn't need them
Your Sunday friends
And so you watched them
Like grains of sand

Running one by one
Out of your hands
Softly falling
