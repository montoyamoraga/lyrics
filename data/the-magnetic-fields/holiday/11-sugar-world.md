# Sugar World

Please forgive me
For all the things I do
Sugar give me
The love I need to carry on
Living living
Without you I'd just die
With you with you
I can hold my head up high
And tell the crowd that I'm so proud
It makes me want to cry

Sugar world of you
To me you're champagne or ruhr wine
Sugar world what can I do
Will you make up your mind
Sugar world you're so sweet
You're lemon or you're lime
You're a sugar world to me
You're pecan or praline
You're sky bar or cloud nine

Sugar save me
Come on save me from myself
Enslave me
I never wanted anything else
Looking looking
Into your candy eyes
Talking talking
About the day when I
Can make a vow but that's not now
It makes me want to cry

Sugar world of you
To me you're champagne or ruhr wine
Sugar world what can I do
Will you make up your mind
Sugar world you're so sweet
You're lemon or you're lime
You're a sugar world to me
You're pecan or praline
You're sky bar or cloud nine

Sugar world of you
To me you're champagne or ruhr wine
Sugar world what can I do
Will you make up your mind
Sugar world you're so sweet
You're lemon or you're lime
You're a sugar world to me
You're pecan or praline
You're sky bar or cloud nine
