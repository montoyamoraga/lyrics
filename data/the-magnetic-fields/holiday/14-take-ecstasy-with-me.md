# Take Ecstasy With Me  

You used to slide down the carpeted stairs  
Or down the banister  
You stuttered like a kaleidoscope  
Cause you knew too many words  
You used to make gingerbread houses  
We used to have taffy pulls  

Take ecstasy  
With me baby  
Take ecstasy  
With me  

You had a black snowmobile  
We drove out under the northern lights  
A vodka bottle gave you those raccoon eyes  
We got beat up just for holding hands  

Take ecstasy  
With me baby  
Take ecstasy  
With me  

Take ecstasy  
With me baby  
Take ecstasy  
With me
