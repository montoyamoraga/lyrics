# Swinging London  

I read your manifestoes and your strange religious tracts  
You took me to your library and kissed me in the stacks  

Planets crash the world goes nova  
Sun explodes all goes black  
You went off swinging London  
And forgot to come back  

You couldn't grok my racecar but you dug the roadside blur  
You weren't into my airplane but you loved the whirling world  

Planets crash the world goes nova  
Sun explodes all goes black  
You went off swinging London  
And forgot to come back  

Planets crash the world goes nova  
Sun explodes all goes black  
You went off swinging London  
And forgot to come back  

Baby come back
