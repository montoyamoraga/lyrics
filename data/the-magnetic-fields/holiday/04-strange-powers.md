# Strange Powers  

On the ferris wheel  
Looking out on Coney Island  
Under more stars than  
There are prostitutes in Thailand  

Our hair in the air  
Our lips blue from cotton candy  
When we kiss it feels  
Like a flying saucer landing  

And I can't sleep  
Cause you got strange powers  
You're in my dreams  
Strange powers  

In Las Vegas where  
The electric bills are staggering  
The decor hog wild  
And the entertainment saccharin  

What a golden age  
What a time of right and reason  
The consumer's king  
And unhappiness is treason  

And I can't sleep  
Cause you got strange powers  
You're in my dreams  
Strange powers  

The sun falls down like honey  
The moon pours down like mercury  
The stars fall down like money  
And you come down to me  

And I can't sleep  
Cause you got strange powers  
You're in my dreams  
Strange powers  

And I can't sleep  
Cause you got strange powers  
You're in my dreams  
Strange powers
