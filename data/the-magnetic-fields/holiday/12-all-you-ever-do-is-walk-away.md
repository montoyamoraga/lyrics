# All You Ever Do Is Walk Away

Sad as a painted clown
A beautiful boy in an ugly town
But when your circus closes down
Don't walk away from me

You've been asleep too long
The birds are bruises in the dawn
The pounds of flesh between us stretch
As far as you can see

But all you ever do is walk away
And I know if you'd only go slow
You could see what it means
To be making the scene with me

All you ever do is walk away
And I think if you tried you could find 
A little time for the life
I can see in your eyes
Don't go
Don't go

Sometimes you just explode
And no one alive can break your code
You have a language of your own
An unconnected road
The people you called your friends
The places you won't go again
The decades lost in finding them
You'll have to let them go

But all you ever do is walk away
And I know if you'd only go slow
You could see what it means
To be making the scene with me

All you ever do is walk away
And I think if you tried you could find 
A little time for the life
I can see in your eyes
Don't go
Don't go
