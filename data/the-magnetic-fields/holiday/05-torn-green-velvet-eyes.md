# Torn Green Velvet Eyes

You know the rain is gone
When the sky is full of dust
And the tears are gone
When your eyes are red as rust

And it just rains because it can
And you just cry until you can't

But I can feel my courage crumble
And my heart just turns to ice
When I see myself reflected
In your torn green velvet eyes

You know the night is gone
When the sunlight burns your eyes
And the cold is gone
When the room is full of flies

And it's all a waste of time
If you try to change your mind

But I can feel my courage crumble
And my heart just turns to ice
When I see myself reflected
In your torn green velvet eyes

And it's all a waste of time
If you try to change your mind

But I can feel my courage crumble
And my heart just turns to ice
When I see myself reflected
In your torn green velvet eyes
In your torn green velvet eyes
In your velvet eyes
