# Desert Island

I'll be the madness
That carries you away
I'll be the sadness
To light your darkest day

I'll be the desert island
Where you can be free
I'll be the vulture
You can catch and eat

Desert island
Love is all around
Desert island
Where you can laugh aloud

Desert island
Everywhere's a beach
Your desert island
That's what I wanna be

We'll develop muscles
From cracking coconuts
Let our clothing drop off
Feel each other's butts

Start a better country
Where we can get things done
Make a fortune turning
Sand to silicon

Desert island
Love is all around
Desert island
Where you can laugh aloud

Desert island
Everywhere's a beach
Your desert island
That's what I wanna be

While we're still holding on
Counting days until we're gone
Can we spend some time alone
In our free love zone

Desert island
Love is all around
Desert island
Where you can laugh aloud

Desert island
Everywhere's a beach
Your desert island
That's what I wanna be

Desert island
Desert island
Desert island
