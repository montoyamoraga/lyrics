# In My Secret Place  

Time swings  
Like a wrecking ball into things  
Youth fades  
As quickly as a hit parade  

But as the days go by  
In the gray world outside  
Days grow on colorful trees  

In my secret place  
In my secret place  

They'll sell  
Your tickets for their carousel  
Don't pay  
They'll get your money either way  

You can go up and down  
You can go round and round  
But there's a better fairground  

In my secret place  
In my secret place
