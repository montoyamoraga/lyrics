# The Trouble I've Been Looking For  

Crows in the trees  
Spanish hotels on the sea  
We wave goodbye  
Airplanes draw swords in the sky  

I'm so rich and you're so bored  
Are you the trouble I've been looking for  
You go out and you slam the door  
Are you the trouble I've been looking for  

My eyes still burn  
Whether you leave or return  
The flowers bloom  
When you walk into the room  

I'm so rich and you're so bored  
Are you the trouble I've been looking for  
You go out and you slam the door  
Are you the trouble I've been looking for  

You stole it all  
And wrote my name on a wall  
I've moved again  
I've changed my name again  

I'm so rich and you're so bored  
Are you the trouble I've been looking for  
You go out and you slam the door  
Are you the trouble I've been looking for
