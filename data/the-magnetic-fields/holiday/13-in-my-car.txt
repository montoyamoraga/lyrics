# In My Car

You were mean to me
And broke my heart
Now you've gone away
And we're apart
But I've got a special machine
To take me where
Things turned out differently
And you still care

In my car
I'm in my car
I'm taking a ride to somewhere inside
Where you never left and I never cried
I'm taking a ride to somewhere inside
Where you never left me and I never cried
At the speed of light
In my car

Never going back to this world
I know where I belong
Where I'm your girl
So I've got fuzzy dice
To bring me luck
Roll me to a better place
Where we can rock

In my car
I'm in my car
I'm taking a ride to somewhere inside
Where you never left and I never cried
I'm taking a ride to somewhere inside
Where you never left me and I never cried
At the speed of light
In my car

I'm in my car
In my car
I'm taking a ride to somewhere inside
Where you never left and I never cried
I'm taking a ride to somewhere inside
Where you never left me and I never cried
At the speed of light
In my car
