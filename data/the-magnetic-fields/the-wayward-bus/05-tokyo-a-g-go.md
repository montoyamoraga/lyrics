# Tokyo Á Go-Go

I was only doing my job
For the company
With a gun in my pocket and
No identity
I fell in love with you
But we're not free

Tokyo Á go-go
Tokyo Á go-go

The dancing spies
With evil eyes
That walk the night

Tokyo Á go-go
Tokyo Á go-go

In colored scenes
The dancing queens
With laser beams

You were just another boy
Only seventeen
Well designed for giving pleasure
Just a love machine
Now we've got to run away
We're turning green

Tokyo Á go-go
Tokyo Á go-go

The dancing spies
With evil eyes
That walk the night

Tokyo Á go-go
Tokyo Á go-go

In colored scenes
The dancing queens
With laser beams
