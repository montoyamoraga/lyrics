# Old Orchard Beach  

Was there some part of you  
Tail or hunchback  
That when they cut it off grew back  

You were a little girl  
With starry eyes  
Now you're a sad young man and no one knows why  

When we go dancing  
Underneath the city in the catacombs  
When we go dancing  
The strobe lights and the disco will bring us home  

I know Old Orchard Beach  
Is where you belong  
You can go back but baby  
That won't make you young  

The wind will blow or it won't  
The stars come out or they don't  
The world goes round or we get thrown into the stars  

When we go dancing  
Underneath the city in the catacombs  
When we go dancing  
The strobe lights and the disco will bring us home
