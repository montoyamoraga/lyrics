# Dancing in Your Eyes

The summer came and passed us by
We didn't care we just let it die
But when we dance just you and I

When we walk hand in hand in the rain
When we're young and in love once again
We will dance in the autumn with the leaves in our hair
When I look I'll be dancing in your eyes
When I look I'll be dancing in your eyes

You've gone away over the sea
You will return it's meant to be
Never regret your time with me

When we walk hand in hand in the rain
When we're young and in love once again
We will dance in the autumn with the leaves in our hair
When I look I'll be dancing in your eyes
When I look I'll be dancing in your eyes

When we walk hand in hand in the rain
When we're young and in love once again
We will dance in the autumn with the leaves in our hair
When I look I'll be dancing in your eyes
When I look I'll be dancing in your eyes
