# The Saddest Story Ever Told

We used to go out on the summer nights
And dance in the neon rain
We used to hold hands at the movie show
But we'll never hold hands again

Dododo dodo come on
Dododo dodo come on

Those days are gone
You and I were young
Those summer nights

You'll see the world
Diving for a girl
You'll never find

And then we'll quietly grow old
The saddest story ever told

Once upon a time we fell in love
Or at least that's what you said
You say I can find someone else
But I just wish I was dead

Dododo dodo come on
Dododo dodo come on

Those days are gone
You and I were young
Those summer nights

You'll see the world
Diving for a girl
You'll never find

And then we'll quietly grow old
The saddest story ever told
