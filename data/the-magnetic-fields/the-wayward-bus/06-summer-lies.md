# Summer Lies

We used to dance
Like it was going out of style
When you loved me for a while
And I remember every word you ever said
Every kiss

We used to sing
All the oldest songs we knew
But the words were never true for you
Or was it all a game of solitaire
Played in the dark

All the sweetest things you said
And I believed were summer lies
Hanging in the willow trees
Like the dead were summer lies
I'll never fall in love again

I whispered too
But the things I said were true
And I gave up my whole world for you
I gave you all the best years of my life
And half the worst

And now you're gone
I pine and wane pale and wan
Never knowing when it's dawn curtains drawn
Hiding in my room wasting away
Cutting myself

All the sweetest things you said
And I believed were summer lies
Hanging in the willow trees
Like the dead were summer lies
I'll never fall in love again
