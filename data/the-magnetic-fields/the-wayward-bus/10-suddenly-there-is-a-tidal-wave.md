# Suddenly There Is a Tidal Wave

You held me upside-down
Til I couldn't breathe anymore
Then you held me like a baby

Television like wine
And cigarettes like grains of sand
And raspberry schnapps like a thousand suns

The boys talk like they own the world
The women keep their stupid diaries
But suddenly there's a tidal wave
And everything is sucked out to sea

There were probably birds
Outside our little room
I don't remember anything but you

We must have been the butt
Of all the jokes in the world
For trying to live like Pippi Longstocking

The boys talk like they own the world
The women keep their stupid diaries
But suddenly there's a tidal wave
And everything is sucked out to sea

The boys talk like they own the world
The women keep their stupid diaries
But suddenly there's a tidal wave
And everything is sucked out to sea
