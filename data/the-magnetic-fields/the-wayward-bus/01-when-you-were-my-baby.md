# When You Were My Baby  

We walked alone in the rain and lightning  
When you were my baby  
So much in love it was almost frightening  
When you were my baby  

Everybody called you a fool  
When you wouldn't play by the rules  
Everybody was wrong whoa whoa  

There was nowhere to run away to  
When you were my baby   
Everybody began to hate you  
When you were my baby  

Time wasn't on our side  
Me and my foolish pride  
Then I said goodbye whoa whoa  

Now you've gone away and left me on my own  
Now I'm walking down the highway all alone  
On a rainy night and crying out my eyes  
Crying out my eyes  
Crying out my  
Crying out my eyes  

We were young yeah but old enough too  
When you were my baby  
And I just couldn't help but love you  
When you were my baby  

Just the way you wore your hair  
And the way you just didn't care  
And the way you danced
