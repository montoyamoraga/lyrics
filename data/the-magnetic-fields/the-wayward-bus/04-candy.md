# Candy  

Candy  
It's been really nice  
But I've got to go  

Cause I can't be  
The part of your life
You don't want to know  

And I can't  
Keep lying all the time  
And I know you'll find a better man  
They're all too easy to find  
And I'll just go away somewhere  
And slowly lose my mind  

Candy  
They called you a baby  
They called you a whore  

And I can't see  
The light at the end  
For you anymore  

And I can't  
Keep lying all the time  
And I know you'll find a better man  
They're all too easy to find  
And I'll just go away somewhere  
And slowly lose my mind  

Candy  
I can't be the man  
They want me to be  

Maybe  
It was only with you  
That I could be me  

And I can't  
Keep lying all the time  
And I know you'll find a better man  
They're all too easy to find  
And I'll just go away somewhere  
And slowly lose my mind
