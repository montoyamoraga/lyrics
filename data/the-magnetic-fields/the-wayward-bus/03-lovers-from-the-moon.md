# Lovers From the Moon

They say everyone you touch turns to gold
They say we're too young I think we're too old
Ugly as sin pale and thin
They've been wrong before

They say you're a frog prince swollen with pride
Always a bridesmaid never a bride
Getting confused in Santa Cruz
Living in a dream

Touching across the room
Like lovers from the moon
Dancing all night to the tune
Of lovers from the moon

I'm not afraid to walk hand in hand
I think we were made to lie in the sand
Decadently by the sea
Under the sun

Touching across the room
Like lovers from the moon
Dancing all night to the tune
Of lovers from the moon
