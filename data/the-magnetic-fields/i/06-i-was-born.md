# I Was Born  

I was born  
I hate this part  
Being someone new  
Being torn  
Seeing someone who died  
As you grew  

Growing older  
Is killing a child  
Who laughed and smiled at anything  
Growing colder  
And less and less wild  
And learning to sing  

I was young  
Then not so young  
Scary either way  
One more rung  
Down that black ladder every day  

One more floor  
Down the elevator  
To oblivion  
What fun  
But the singularly awful one  
Is being born
