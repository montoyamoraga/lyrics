# Infinitely Late at Night  

It was infinitely late at night  
The stars are still out there  
But they're all out of light  

Don't worry about me  
I'll be alright  
It's just infinitely late at night  

It's still getting later  
And later and later  
I feel like I'm in a falling elevator  

I'd kill for a drink  
But I can't find the waiter  
I really believe he's gone home  

Oh god I wish I could go home  
But it's infinitely late at night  

Is this a blackout or am I losing my sight  
It should have been noon now  
The sun should be bright  
But it's infinitely  

The hour on the bar clock  
It isn't finite  
It's all black and white  
Without the white  
It's just infinitely late at night
