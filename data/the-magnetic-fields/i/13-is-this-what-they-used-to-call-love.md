# Is This What They Used to Call Love  

Feels like December but it's May
I've gone as pale as Doris Day  
The blue sky's torn asunder  
By clouds that warn of thunder  
Is this what they used to call love  

Your face surrounds me everywhere  
Like a kaleidoscope's nightmare  
This outpouring information  
As boring as an ocean  
Is this what they used to call love  

Well it mustn't be the chicken pox  
I've never met a chicken  
But whenever I get near you dear  
My heart starts to sicken  

In the ninth circle of this hell  
My heart is burning and unwell  
What demons lie within it  
I'll die in one more minute  
Is this what they used to call love  
Is this what they used to call love
