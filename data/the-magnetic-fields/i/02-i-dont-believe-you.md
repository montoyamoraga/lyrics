# I Don't Believe You  

So you quote love unquote me  
Well stranger things have come to be  
But let's agree to disagree  
Cause I don't believe you  
I don't believe you  

You tell I'm not not cute  
It's truth or falsity is moot  
Cause honesty's not your strong suit  
And I don't believe you  
I don't believe you  

You tell of what once was  
And all about Buck Butch and Buzz  
How they were not like me because  
But I don't believe you  
I don't believe you  

I had a dream and you were in it  
The blue of your eyes was infinite  
You seemed to be  
In love with me  
Which isn't very realistic  

You may sing me they were you  
And I start crying halfway through  
But nothing else you say is true  
So I don't believe you  
I don't believe you  

You may set your charm on stun  
And say I'm delightful and fun  
But you say that to everyone  
Well I don't believe you  
I don't believe you  

So you're brilliant gorgeous and  
Ampersand after ampersand  
You think I just don't understand  
But I don't believe you  
I don't believe you  
I don't believe you  
I don't believe you
