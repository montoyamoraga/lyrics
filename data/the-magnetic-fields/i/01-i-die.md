# I Die

I die when you walk by
So beautiful and strong
Each day you pass my way
In your bubble where nothing goes wrong

You think your youth a permanent truth
But here is a tear for your eye
Having forgotten how to cry I die

You think your youth a permanent truth
But here is a tear for your eye
Having forgotten how to cry I die
