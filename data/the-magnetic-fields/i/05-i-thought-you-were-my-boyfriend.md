# I Thought You Were My Boyfriend

You told me you loved me
I know where and when
Come sunrise surprise surprise
The joke's on me again

I know you don't love me
You know I don't care
Keep it hidden better
Did I say the world was fair

I thought I was just the guy for you and it would never end
I thought we were supposed to be like glue
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend

Lover or not I've always got ten guys on whom I can depend
And if you're not mine one less is nine get wise
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend

I just hope you're happy
Stringing me along
While you're stringing I'm here singing
This my saddest song

I wish I could see you
I wish I could sleep
Should I freak out should I seek out
Someone I could keep

I thought I was just the guy for you and it would never end
I thought we were supposed to be like glue
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend

Lover or not I've always got ten guys on whom I can depend
And if you're not mine one less is nine get wise
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend

I wanted you tonight
I walked around a lot
Wishing you were here to keep me from sleeping

With anyone who might
Want me or even not
Some guys have a beer and they'll do
Anything
Anything
Anything

I thought I was just the guy for you and it would never end
I thought we were supposed to be like glue
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend

Lover or not I've always got ten guys on whom I can depend
And if you're not mine one less is nine get wise
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend

I thought I was just the guy for you and it would never end
I thought we were supposed to be like glue
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend

Lover or not I've always got ten guys on whom I can depend
And if you're not mine one less is nine get wise
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend

I thought I was just the guy for you and it would never end
I thought we were supposed to be like glue
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend

Lover or not I've always got ten guys on whom I can depend
And if you're not mine one less is nine get wise
I thought you were my boyfriend
I thought you were my boyfriend
