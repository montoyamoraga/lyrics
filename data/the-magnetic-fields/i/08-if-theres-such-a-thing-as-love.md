# If There's Such a Thing as Love  

Now the clock is striking one  
So we might as well begin it  
As there's dancing to be done  
And our time is not infinite  

If there's such a thing as love  
Such a thing as love  
If there's such a thing as love  
I'm in it  

So you claim you love me too  
Lloyd's of London guarantee it  
Gaze into these eyes of blue  
Yo do love me I decree it  

If there's such a thing as love  
Such a thing as love  
If there's such a thing as love  
Give me it  

When I was two and a half  
My momma said to me  
Love is funny you will laugh  
Till the day you turn three  

Like a kitten up a tree  
Needs a fireman to rescue it  
So your fireman I will be  
And I'll really get into it  

If there's such a thing as love  
Such a thing as love  
If there's such a thing as love  
Let's do it  

I thought I'd known love before  
That was not it but I thought it  
So I thought I'd win the war  
Or I never would have fought it  

If there's such a thing as love  
Such a thing as love  
If there's such a thing as love  
I've caught it  

If there's such a thing as love  
Such a thing as love  
If there's such a thing as love  
I've caught it  

If there's such a thing as love  
Such a thing as love  
If there's such a thing as love  
I've caught it
