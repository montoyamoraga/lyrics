# I Looked All Over Town  

I wandered in these big blue shoes  
Til we had nothing left to lose  
Nobody wants you when you're a circus clown  
I should know  
I looked all over town  

I guess folks just don't like my face  
They make out like I'm some disgrace  
But nothing's gonna change this painted frown  
And I know  
I looked all over town  

Maybe somewhere I could be free  
Somewhere they won't throw rocks at me  
Somewhere this crazy hair could be my crown  
But all my life  
I looked all over town  

So whistling a circus tune  
I inflated one more balloon  
And as I floated up I looked straight down  
And I looked all over town  
One last time  
I looked all over town
