# I Don't Really Love You Anymore  

True I'd give my right arm  
To keep you safe from harm  
And true for you I'd move to Ecuador  

And I'd keep a little farm  
Chop wood to keep you warm  
But I don't really love you anymore  

I don't have to love you now if I don't wish to  
I won't see you anyhow if that's an issue  

Because I'm a gentleman  
Think of me as just your fan  
Who remembers every dress you ever wore  

Just the bad comedian  
Your new boyfriend's better than  
Cause I don't really love you anymore  

There'll be someday when your eyes do not enthrall me  
I'll be num I realize you'll never call me  

Cause I've read your horoscope  
And now I've given up all hope  
So I don't really love you anymore  

Cause I've read your horoscope  
And now I've given up all hope  
So I don't really love you anymore
