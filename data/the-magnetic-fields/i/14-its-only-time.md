# It's Only Time

Why would I stop loving you
A hundred years from now
It's only time
It's only time
It's only time

What could stop this beating heart
Once it's made a vow
It's only time
It's only time
It's only time

If rain won't change your mind
Let it fall
The rain won't change my heart
At all

Lock this chain
Around my hand
Throw away the key
It's only time
It's only time
It's only time

Years falling
Like grains of sand
Mean nothing to me
It's only time
It's only time
It's only time

If snow won't change your mind
Let it fall
The snow won't change my heart
Not at all

I'll walk your lands
I'll walk your lands
And swim your sea
And swim your sea

Marry me
Marry me

Then in your hands
Then in your hands
I will be free
I will be free

Marry me
Marry me

Why would I stop loving you
A hundred years from now
