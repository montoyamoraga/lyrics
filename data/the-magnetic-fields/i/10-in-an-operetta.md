# In an Operetta  

Sing me the kind of song you hear  
In an operetta  
In an operetta  

Sing me the words I long to hear  
Out of Violetta  
In an operetta  

She will fast be outcast from her castle  
With nary a friend  
But since she's a princess there's hints  
Of a prince in the end  

She'll enjoy some employ as a boy  
With her name changed to Pip  
Soon by gum she'll become the brave captain  
Of some pirate ship  

Singing a thing fit for a king  
In an operetta  
In an operetta  

It's all the singing all-dancing  
Princess Violetta  
Of the operetta  
In an operetta  
Within an operetta
