# I Wish I Had An Evil Twin  

I wish I had an evil twin  
Running around doing people in  
I wish I had  
A very bad  
An evil twin to do my will  
To cull and conquer cut and kill  
Just like I would  
If I weren't good  
And if I knew where to begin  

Down and down he'd go  
How low no one would know  
Sometimes the good life wears thin  
I wish I had an evil twin  

My evil twin would lie and steal  
And he would stink of sex appeal  
All men would writhe  
Beneath his scythe  
He'd send the pretty ones to me  
And they would think that I was he  
I'd hurt them and I'd go scot free  
I'd get no blame  
And feel no shame  
Cause evil's not my cup of tea  

Down and down he'd go  
How low no one would know  
All my life there should have been  
An evil twin
