# I Don't Like Your Tone

You sigh that I should try your love
I'll never be alone
That you are true you coo my dove
But I don't like your tone

You were you murmur further just a child
But now you're grown
You hiss that this is bliss god blessed
But I don't like your tone

What's with all this purring
Are you a cat
Why are we whispering
Love's not like that

When near I hear how clear you make
Your so called feelings known
It's queer my dear I fear heartbreak
But I don't like your tone
