# I'd Go Anywhere with Hugh

I'd go anywhere with Hugh
Hugh's the kind of boy I take to
Mother of god if he only knew
I'd go anywhere with Hugh

I'd do anything for him
Sacre bleu when the lights are dim
I'd entertain each and every whim
I'd do anything for him

I love Hugh
And Hugh loves you
You love me
And he does not
I don't love you
You don't love Hugh
What a sad gavotte

Hugh'd go anywhere with you
Hugh would take you to Timbuktu
You would anything for me
Me I'd go anywhere with Hugh
Who'd do anything for you
Who'd go anywhere with me
I'd do anything for Hugh
He would go anywhere with you
