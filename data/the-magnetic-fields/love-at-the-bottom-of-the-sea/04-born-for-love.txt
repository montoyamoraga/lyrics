# Born for Love

Hey little cutie
I was born for love
Can't count the chains
I have worn for love
Killed three men and one
Unicorn for love
But I won't mind if you just
Take me home

Hey little darling
I was made for love
Got down on my knees
And I prayed for love
Crawled from Tamworth to
Adelaide for love
But I won't mind if you just
Take me home

I know you've been lonely
And misunderstood
But I'm yours for the asking
For now or for good
If you want me to leave
You just give a shove
But you won't because
I was born for love

Hey little cutie
I was born for love
Can't count the chains
I have worn for love
Killed three men and one
Unicorn for love
But I won't mind if you just
Take me home
