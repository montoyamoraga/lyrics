# I've Run Away to Join the Fairies

I've run away to join the fairies
This mortal world has lost its charms
I'll be a flower for their garden
Never to hold you in my arms

They will enchance me and enslave me
And make a fool of me their fool for fun
Upon my head they'll place an ass
More or less as you've always done

I loved you like I was your baby
Although you couldn't even fly
And though you held no eldritch secrets
All too enthralled to you was I

In yonder forest grows a toadstool
To make the mind of man grow small
They will mistake me for their changeling
I wasn't human after all
