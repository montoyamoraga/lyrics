# God Wants Us to Wait

I think I know what you would like us to do
When we have children let's have seventy-two
Until then we must be resigned to our fate
I love you baby but God wants us to wait

I guess it's true I should have told you before
And not have waited til we're nude on the floor
Though it would be the perfect end to our date
I love you baby but God wants us to wait

Now you might like to kiss the dew on my hem
But one male and female created he them
Our lord intended us forever to mate
I love you baby but God wants us to wait

Despite my beauty and the scent of jasmine
Could you be happy in the knowledge of sin
Although it may not be a crime in our state
I love you baby but God wants us to wait

How much more wonderful to anticipate
I love you baby but God wants us to wait
