# All She Cares About Is Mariachi

You want to light your flame in her hibachi
Well brother I can tell you in advance
That all she cares about is mariachi
And all she ever wants to do is dance

Go there and wear your hair like Liberace
Go wear some freakish fragrance fresh from France
Friend all she cares about is mariachi
And all she ever wants to do is dance

So go ahead and hire Saatchi and Saatchi
To advertise the sausage in your pants
But all she cares about is mariachi
And all she ever wants to do is dance
