# The Machine in Your Hand

I want to be the machine in your hand
And go wherever you go
Your every touch would be my command
And I wouldn't be so slow
We'd be together in wonderland
And I'd light you with my glow
I want to be the machine in your hand
And go wherever you go

I don't know I love you
You're not really a person
More a gadget with meat stuck to it
I see less and less of you
As you worsen and worsen
I think you're disappearing through it
No doubt you're just ahead of the curve
I only wish that I had the nerve to say

I want to be the machine in your hand
And go wherever you go
Your every touch would be my command
And I wouldn't be so slow
We'd be together in wonderland
And I'd light you with my glow
I want to be the machine in your hand
And go wherever you go

You can hold me for hours
Wouldn't that be terrific
We can feel our connection growing
I'll have magical powers
Only less scientific
You and I will become all knowing
Such a machine what would it be worth
Stick with me kid we'll conquer the earth

I want to be the machine in your hand
And go wherever you go
Your every touch would be my command
And I wouldn't be so slow
We'd be together in wonderland
And I'd light you with my glow
I want to be the machine in your hand
And go wherever you go
