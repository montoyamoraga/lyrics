# Your Girlfriend's Face

So I've taken a contract out on you
I have hired a hitman to do what they do
He will do his best to do his worst
After he's messed up your girlfriend first
I said he'll do his worst
To your girlfriend first

Cause I've hired a fixer for her too
For stealing my lover and making me blue
They'll have to hose off your twisted place
After he blows off your girlfriend's face
I want the whole bloody place
Red with your girlfriend's face

So I've taken a contract out on y'all
For making me feel infinitely small
In the evenings I've devised your death
Being buried alive on crystal meth
Baby I give you death
Bye bye bye crystal meth

Baby I give you death
Bye bye bye crystal meth
Baby I give you death
Bye bye bye crystal meth

Baby I give you death
Bye bye bye crystal meth
Baby I give you death
Bye bye bye crystal meth
