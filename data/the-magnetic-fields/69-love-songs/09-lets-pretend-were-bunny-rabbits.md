# Let's Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits  

If you knew how I long  
For you now that you're gone  
You'd grow wings and fly  
Home to me  
Home tonight  
And in the morning sun  

Let's pretend we're bunny rabbits  
Let's do it all day long  
Let abbots, Babbitts and Cabots  
Say mother nature's wrong  

And when we've had a couple of beers  
We'll put on bunny suits  
I long to nibble your ears  
And do as bunnies do  

Let's pretend we're bunny rabbits  
Let's do it all day long  
Rapidly becoming rabid  
Singing little rabbit songs  

I can keep it up all night  
I can keep it up all day  
Let's pretend we're bunny rabbits  
Until we pass away  

Let's pretend we're bunny rabbits  
Until we pass away
