# For We Are the King of the Boudoir

Should time allow us to describe our prowess
It would be quite hard to overrate
For we are the king of the boudoir old thing
And the king doesn't like to wait

One tryst with me and you'll be spinning like a gyroscope
One tryst with me and you'll be pope

Should modesty allow us to describe our prowesslessnesslessness
It would be hard to overstate
For we are the king of the boudoir it's true
And the king doesn't like to wait

One kiss from me and you'll be overjoyed and overawed
One kiss from me and you'll see god

For we are the king of the boudoir we are
And the king doesn't like to wait
