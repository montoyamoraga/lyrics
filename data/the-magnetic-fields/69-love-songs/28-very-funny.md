# Very Funny  

Everybody knows but me  
When you go where you shouldn't be  
Everybody knows but me  
Where you go when you're feeling free  
Everybody knows but me  

So you go there for a laugh  
You just go to take photographs  
To believe that I'd be daft  
But yes I think you go for a laugh  

And you say I love you honey  
Very funny
