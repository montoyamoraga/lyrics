# Parades Go By  

I'll linger here  
Your ring upon my finger dear  
And sing till dawn  
A song of you and me and what and why  

For time is all I have to keep  
Between these walls  
And half asleep  

The days go by  
A million little  
Nights and days go by  
And I don't mind  
Parades go by  
So many beautiful  
Parades go by  
Leave me behind  

I'll sit and stare  
How could I venture anywhere  
And let the centuries fall where they may  
But never die  
For I have loved  
And so I lost the world above  
Beyond the moss  

The days go by  
A million little  
Nights and days go by  
And I don't mind  
Parades go by  
So many beautiful  
Parades go by  
Leave me behind  

The days go by  
A million little  
Nights and days go by  
And I don't mind  
Parades go by  
So many beautiful  
Parades go by  
Leave me behind
