# I Think I Need a New Heart  

Time stands still  
All I can feel is the time standing still  
As you put down the keys  
And say don't call me please  
While the radio plays  

I think I need a new heart  
Oh  
I think I need a new heart  

You've lied too  
But it's a sin that I can't tell the truth  
Cause it all comes out wrong  
Unless I put it in a song  
So the radio plays  

I think I need a new heart  
Just for you  
I think I need a new heart  

Cause I always say I love you  
When I mean turn on the light  
And I say let's run away  
When I just mean stay the night  

But the words you want to hear  
You will never hear from me  
I'll never say  
Happy anniversary
Never stay to say  
Happy anniversary

So  
I think I need a new heart  
Oh  
I think I need a new heart  
Oh  
I think I need a new heart  
Oh  
I think I need a new heart  
Give me time
