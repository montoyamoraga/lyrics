# Time Enough for Rocking When We're Old  

There'll be time enough for rocking when we're old  
We can rock all day in rocking chairs of gold  
But tonight I think I'd rather just go dancing  
There'll be time enough for rocking when we are old my love  

There'll be time enough for talk in the nursing home  
Darling time enough to write an epic poem  
But tonight I think I'd rather just go dancing  
There'll be time enough for talk in the home my love  

There'll be time enough for sleeping when we're dead  
You will have a velvet pillow for your head  
But tonight I think I'd rather just go dancing  
There'll be time enough for sleeping when we're dead my love  

There'll be time for sex and drugs in heaven  
When our pheromones are turned up to eleven  
But tonight I think I'd rather just go dancing  
There'll be time enough for sex and drugs in heaven my love  
And time enough for rocking when we're old
