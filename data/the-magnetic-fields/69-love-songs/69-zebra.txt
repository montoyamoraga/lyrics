# Zebra

So we got married in Venice in June so what
We circled the earth in a hot air balloon so what
And the rest of our lives is one long honeymoon
Well that doesn't mean we are in love

If you really loved me
You'd buy me a beautiful pearl
But you've already bought me
All of the pearls in the world
So there's one thing I crave
When my days become ho hum and blah
I want a zebra

We've got so many tchotchkes
We've practically emptied the Louvre
In most of our palaces
There's hardly room to maneuver
Well I shan't go to Bali today
I must stay home and hoovre
Up the gold dust
That doesn't mean we're in love

If you really loved me
You'd buy me the great pyramid
Oh I'm so forgetful you already did
But there's only one thing I need
If you won't think I'm greedy my dear
Another zebra
Zelda looks lonely
I want a zebra
