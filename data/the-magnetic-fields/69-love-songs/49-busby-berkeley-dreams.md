# Busby Berkeley Dreams  

I should have forgotten you long ago  
But you're in every song I know  
Whining and pining is wrong and so  
On and so forth of course of course  
But no you can't have a divorce  

I haven't seen you in ages  
But it's not as bleak as it seems  
We still dance on whirling stages  
In my Busby Berkeley dreams  

The tears have stained all the pages  
Of my true romance magazines  
We still dance in my outrageously  
Beautiful Busby Berkeley dreams  

And now you want to leave me for good  
I refuse to believe you could  
You forget we're not made of wood  
Well darling you may do your worst  
Because you'll have to kill me first  

I haven't seen you in ages  
But it's not as bleak as it seems  
We still dance on whirling stages  
In my Busby Berkeley dreams  

The tears have stained all the pages  
Of my true romance magazines  
We still dance in my outrageously  
Beautiful Busby Berkeley dreams  

I haven't seen you in ages  
But it's not as bleak as it seems  
We still dance on whirling stages  
In my Busby Berkeley dreams  

The tears have stained all the pages  
Of my true romance magazines  
We still dance in my outrageously  
Beautiful Busby Berkeley dreams  

Do you think it's dangerous  
To have Busby Berkeley dreams
