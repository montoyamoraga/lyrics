# Two Kinds of People

There are two kinds of people
A my love and I
B other

Two kinds of people
One the gray
And two me and my lover

Al people fall into two camps
That ever twain shall be
Those lost in darkness without lamps
And then my love and me

All people fall into two camps
That ever twain shall be
Those lost in darkness without lamps
And then my love and me
