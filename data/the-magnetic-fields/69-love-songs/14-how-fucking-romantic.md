# How Fucking Romantic

How fucking romantic
All the stars are out
Twinkling twinkling twinkling
And fluttering about
What a tacky sunset
What a vulgar moon
Play another charming
Rodgers and Hart tune

How fucking romantic
Must be really waltz
Drag another clich√©
Howling from the vaults
Love you obviously
Like you really care
Even though you treat me
Like a dancing bear

Toss your bear a goldfish
As it cycles by
Don't forget to feed your
Bear or it'll die
