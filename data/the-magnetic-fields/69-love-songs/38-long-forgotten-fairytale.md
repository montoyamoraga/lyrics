# Long-Forgotten Fairytale  

If someone told me you'd be here  
Whispering these familiar things  
Talking to my little pets  
Smoking the same old cigarettes  
I would have laughed  

I saw you last in summertime  
You said you hated long goodbyes  
You said there's nothing to explain  
In every life a little rain  
Et cetera  

And a long forgotten fairytale  
Is in your eyes again  
And I'm caught inside a dream world  
Where the colors are too intense  
And nothing is making sense  
There's a floating town of eiderdown  
In a mist of mystery  
There's an old enchanted castle  
And the princess there is me  
Decked out like a Christmas tree  

I guess you've had your little joke  
But I have lost my sense of humor  
My medication's wearing off  
Or it's just not strong enough  
To cover this  

And then you kiss me like before  
And I find myself wanting more  
And you tell that little lie  
That kept me hypnotized  
Another kiss  

And a long forgotten fairytale  
Is in your eyes again  
And I'm caught inside a dream world  
Where the colors are too intense  
And nothing is making sense  
There's a floating town of eiderdown  
In a mist of mystery  
There's an old enchanted castle  
And the princess there is me  
Decked out like a Christmas tree  

If someone told me I'd succumb  
If someone said I'd be so dumb  
After all the sleepless nights  
When I turned on all the lights  
I would have hit them  

But I have turned the other cheek  
My voice trembles my knees are weak  
And you beat me once again  
And I know what happens then  
You raise the ante  

And a long forgotten fairytale  
Is in your eyes again  
And I'm caught inside a dream world  
Where the colors are too intense  
And nothing is making sense  
There's a floating town of eiderdown  
In a mist of mystery  
There's an old enchanted castle  
And the princess there is me  
Decked out like a Christmas tree
