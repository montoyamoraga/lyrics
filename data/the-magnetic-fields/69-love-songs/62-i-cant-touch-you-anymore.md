# I Can't Touch You Anymore  

You wanna know  
If we fell in love too fast  
You wanna know  
If this is well too good to last  

You're asking the wrong questions  
You're opening the wrong doors  

I love you I can't touch you anymore  
I can't touch you anymore  
There's so much to hate you for  
I love you I can't touch you anymore  

You want to tell me  
Fifty ways you've left your lovers  
You want to tell me  
How you loved two hundred others  

You're asking the wrong questions  
You're opening the wrong doors  

I love you I can't touch you anymore  
I can't touch you anymore  
There's so much to hate you for  
I love you I can't touch you anymore
