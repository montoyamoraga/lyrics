# Come Back From San Francisco

Come back from San Francisco
It can't be all that pretty
When all of New York City misses you

Should pretty boys in discos
Distract you from your novel
Remember I'm awful in love with you

You need me like the wind needs the trees
To blow in like the moon needs poetry
You need me

Come back from San Francisco
And kiss me I've quit smoking
I miss doing the wild thing with you

Will you stay I don't think so
But all I do is worry
Pack backs call cabs and hurry home to me

You need me like the wind needs the trees
To blow in like the moon needs poetry
You need me

You need me like the wind needs the trees
To blow in like the moon needs poetry
You need me

When you betray me
Betray me with a kiss
Damn you
I've never stayed up as late as this
