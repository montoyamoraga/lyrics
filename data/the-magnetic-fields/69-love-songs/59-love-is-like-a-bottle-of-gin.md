# Love Is Like a Bottle of Gin  

It makes you blind it does you in  
It makes you think you're pretty tough  
It makes you prone to crime and sin  
It makes you say things off the cuff  

It's very small and made of glass  
And grossly over-advertised  
It turns a genius to an ass  
And makes a fool think he is wise  

It could make you regret your birth  
Or turn cartwheels in your best suit  
It costs a lot more than it's worth  
And yet there is no substitute  

They keep it on a higher shelf  
The older and more pure it grows  
It has no color in itself  
But it can make you see rainbows  

You can find it on the Bowery  
Or you can find it at Elaine's  
It makes your words more flowery  
It makes the sun shine makes it rain  

You just get out what they put in  
And they never put in enough  
Love is like a bottle of gin  
But a bottle of gin is not like love
