# I'm Sorry I Love You

A single rose in your garden dwells
Like any rose it's not itself
It is my love in your garden grows
But let's pretend it's just a rose

Well I'm sorry that I love you
It's a phase I'm going through
There is nothing that I can do
And I'm sorry that I love you

Do not listen to my song
Don't remember it don't sing along
Let's pretend it's a work of art
Let's pretend it's not my heart

Well I'm sorry that I love you
It's a phase I'm going through
There is nothing that I can do
And I'm sorry that I love you

The rose will fade when summer's gone
The song will fade and I'll be gone
Because my heart is dying too
And it's all the same to you

Well I'm sorry that I love you
It's a phase I'm going through
There is nothing that I can do
And I'm sorry that I love you

Well I'm sorry that I love you
It's a phase I'm going through
There is nothing that I can do
And I'm sorry that I love you
