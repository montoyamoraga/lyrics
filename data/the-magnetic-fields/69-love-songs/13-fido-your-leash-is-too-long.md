# Fido, Your Leash Is Too Long  

Fido your leash is too long  
You go where you don't belong  
You've been digging in the rubble  
Getting bitches in trouble  
Fido your leash is too long  

Fido your leash is too long  
I don't know where I went wrong  
You scare me out of my wits  
When you do that shih tzu  
Fido your leash is too long  

Fido you've gone far enough  
I must have all of your love  
You've just run out of luck  
I don't care what you foxhounds do  
But your leash is too long
