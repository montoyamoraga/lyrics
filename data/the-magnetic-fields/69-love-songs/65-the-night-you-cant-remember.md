# The Night You Can't Remember  

Before you left your garrison  
You'd had a drink maybe two  
You don't remember Paris hon  
But it remembers you  

It's true we flew to Paris dear  
Aboard an Army jet  
The night you can't remember  
The night I can't forget  

You said I was terrific  
It meant zilch to you ah  
But I have our marriage certificate  
And I'll keep till I die  

You were an army officer  
And I just a rockette  
The night you can't remember  
The night I can't forget  

No rose conveyed your sentiments  
Not even a petunia  
But you've got vague presentiments  
And I've got little junior  

You said nobody loves me  
And I said wanna bet  
The night you can't remember  
The night I can't forget
