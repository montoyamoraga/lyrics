# Wi' Nae Wee Bairn Ye'll Me Beget

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee

But I'll turn into a nightingale
My song will warm thy heart
Well I'll turn into a threshing machine
And tear thy bird apart

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee

But I'll turn into a vampire
And kiss you on the neck
Well I'll turn into a silver cross
And send thee back to heck

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee

But I'll turn into a hydrogen bomb
And atomize the air
Well I'll turn into a cockroach
and you'll see if I care

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee

But I'll turn into a supernova
And burn up everything
Well I'll turn into black little hole
And you'll turn into string

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee

But I'll turn into god himself
And then you'll come to me
Well I will not believe in you
And then where will you be

Wi' nae wee bairn ye'll me beget
Untwinkle little ee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee
My ainly pang'll be regret
A maiden I will dee
