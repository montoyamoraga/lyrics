# Bitter Tears  

Bitter tears keep me going  
Through the years freely flowing  
What have you done  
Only a gun could stop these bitter tears  

The endless streets I walk along  
You made them seem pretty  
But now I dream in country songs  
And wake in New York City  
And the only beauty here  
Is the moon seen through the tear  

Bitter tears keep me going  
Through the years freely flowing  
What have you done  
Only a gun could stop these bitter tears  

I cry because it looks so good  
I cry why not it's free  
And there's nothing more interesting  
Than crying constantly  
And as I tell everyone  
Crying all the time is fun  

Bitter tears keep me going  
Through the years freely flowing  
What have you done  
Only a gun could stop these bitter tears
