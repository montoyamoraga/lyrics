# Washington, D.C.  

W A S H I N G T O N baby D.C.
W A S H I N G T O N baby D.C.

Washington D.C. it's paradise to me  
It's not because it's the grand old seat  
Of precious freedom and democracy no no no  
It's not the greenery turning gold in fall  
The scenery circling the mall  
It's just that's where my baby lives that's all  

Washington D.C. it's the greatest place to be  
It's not the cherries everywhere in bloom  
It's not the way they put folks on the moon no no no  
It's not the spectacles and pageantry  
The thousand things you've got to see  
It's just that's where my baby waits for me  

W A S H I N G T O N baby D.C.
W A S H I N G T O N baby D.C.

Washington D.C. it fits me to a T  
It's not the people doing something real  
It's not the way the springtime makes you feel no no no
It ain't no famous name on a golden plaque  
That makes me ride the railroad track  
It's my baby's kiss that keeps me coming back  
It's my baby's kiss that keeps me coming back
