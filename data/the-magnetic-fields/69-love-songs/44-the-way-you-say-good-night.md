# The Way You Say Good-Night  

So faraway and so alone  
How could I ever take you home  
You're beautiful  
Beautiful  

You've got a devastating point of view  
And everything you say is true  
You're beautiful  
Beautiful  

The night birds start to sing their favorite song  
The way you say goodnight  
The night birds start to sing their favorite song  
And the moon begins to sing  

I kiss you and the sun goes down  
How come it's always dark when you're around  
You're beautiful  
Beautiful  

The night birds sing their favorite song  
The moon begins to sing  
You're beautiful  
Beautiful  

The stars being their busby Berkeley dance  
The way you say goodnight  
And the night becomes a musical extravaganza  
The way you say goodnight  

The way you say goodnight  
I dream of all day long  
Oh I could write a song  
About the way you say goodnight  

The way you say goodnight  
I dream of all day long  
Oh I could write a song  
About the way you say goodnight  

The way you say goodnight  
I dream of all day long  
Oh I could write a song  
About the way you say goodnight
