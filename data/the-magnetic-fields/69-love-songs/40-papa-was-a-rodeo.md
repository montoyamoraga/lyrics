# Papa Was a Rodeo  

I like your twisted point of view Mike  
I like your questioning eyebrows  
You've made it pretty clear what you like  
It's only fair to tell you now  

That I leave early in the morning  
And I won't be back till next year  
I see that kiss-me pucker forming  
But maybe you should plug it with a beer cause  

Papa was a rodeo  
Mamas was a rock and roll band  
I could play guitar and rope a steer  
Before I learned to stand  
Home was anywhere with diesel gas
Love was a trucker's stand  
Never stuck around long enough  
For a one night stand  
Before you kiss me you should know  
Papas was a rodeo  

The light reflecting off the mirror ball  
Looks like a thousand swirling eyes  
They make me think I shouldn't be here at all  
You know every minute someone dies  

What are we doing in this dive bar  
How can you live in a place like this  
Why don't you just get into my car  
And I'll take you away  
I'll take that kiss now but  

Papa was a rodeo  
Mamas was a rock and roll band  
I could play guitar and rope a steer  
Before I learned to stand  
Home was anywhere with diesel gas
Love was a trucker's stand  
Never stuck around long enough  
For a one night stand  
Before you kiss me you should know  
Papas was a rodeo  

And now it's fifty five years later  
We've had the romance of the century  
After all these years wrestling gators  
I still feel like crying when I think of what you said to me  

Papa was a rodeo  
Mamas was a rock and roll band  
I could play guitar and rope a steer  
Before I learned to stand  
Home was anywhere with diesel gas
Love was a trucker's stand  
Never stuck around long enough  
For a one night stand  
Before you kiss me you should know  
Papas was a rodeo  

Ooh  
What a coincidence  
Your papa was a rodeo too
