# I Shatter

Bang there was you
Too gold too blue
You took the truth
I cried you flew

You called me mad
And I am mad
As a hatter

Some fall in love
Some fall in love
I shatter

You make it rain
Too bleak too stark
Should night not fall
You make things dark

You called me mad
And I am mad
As a hatter

Some fall in love
Some fall in love
I shatter

Bang here am I
No one nowhere
No ground no sky
No light no air

You called me mad
And I am mad
As a hatter

Some fall in love
Some fall in love
I shatter
