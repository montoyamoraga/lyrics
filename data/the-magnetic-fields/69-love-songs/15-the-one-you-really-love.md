# The One You Really Love  

I do believe our love's in danger  
I might as well be loving air  
You look at me like I'm a stranger  
You look at me like I'm not there  

I gaze into your eyes of blue  
But their beauty is not for me  
You're thinking of someone who's gone  
You're dreaming of the one you really love  
You're dreaming of the one you really love  

I made you mine or so it seemed  
Though he is dead he haunts your dreams  
I might as well be two feet tall  
You never will love me at all  

I gaze into your eyes of blue  
But their beauty is not for me  
You're thinking of someone who's gone  
You're dreaming of the one you really love  
You're dreaming of the one you really love  

I gaze into your eyes of blue  
But their beauty is not for me  
You're thinking of someone who's gone  
You're dreaming of the one you really love  
You're dreaming of the corpse you really love
