# No One Will Ever Love You  

If you don't mind why don't you mind  
Where is your sense of indignation  
You are too kind much too kind  

Where is the madness that you promised me  
Where is the dream for which I paid dearly  

When things go wrong I sing along  
It is the nature of the business  
But you're not here to make my sad songs more sincere  

No one will ever love you honestly  
No one will ever love you for your honesty  
No one will ever love you honestly  
No one will ever love you for your honesty
