Let this be the epitaph for my heart
Cupid put too much poison in the dart
This is the epitaph for my heart
Because it's gone gone gone

And life goes on and on and on
And death goes on world without end
And you're not my friend

Who will mourn the passing of my heart
Will its little droppings climb the pop chart
Who'll take its ashes and singing
Fling them from the top of the Brill building

And life goes on and on and on
And death goes on world without end
And you're not my friend
