# Abigail, Belle of Kilronan  

Abigail can you feel my heart in the palm of your hand  
And do you understand why I can't stay  
Abigail an evil wind is blowing through the land  
And they need every man to drive it away  

When I come home if I come home  
You'll be a grown woman  
When I come home if I come home  
Don't be alone Abigail Belle of Kilronan  

Abigail is gonna be the beauty of County Galway  
And she will live always in a world of love  
Abigail I'm off to the war but you can be sure  
I will know you're what I'm fighting for  

I'm off to the war but you can be sure  
I will know you're what I'm fighting for  
I'm off to the war but you can be sure  
I will know you're what I'm fighting for  

When I come home if I come home  
You'll be a grown woman  
When I come home if I come home  
Don't be alone Abigail Belle of Kilronan
