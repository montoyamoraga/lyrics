# Love Is Like Jazz  

Love is like jazz  
You make it up as you go along  
And you act as if you really knew the song  
But you don't and you never will  
So you flaunt your mistakes and you make them until  
They  
Were you  

Love is like jazz  
The same song a million times  
The same song a million times  
In different ways  
In different ways  
Strange fruit with and without wind chimes  

It's divine  
It's asinine  
It's depressing  
And it's almost entirely window dressing  
But I'll do
