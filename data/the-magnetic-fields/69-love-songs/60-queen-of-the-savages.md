# Queen of the Savages  

My girl is the queen of the savages  
She don't know the modern world and its ravages  
Instead of money she's got yams and cabbages  
She lives in a dome  
I don't care if I never got home  

My girl is the queen of the jungle folk  
You should see the things we see when we smoke  
We think all of life is a funny joke  
She's sharp as a tack  
I don't care if I never get back  

My girl is the queen of ten villages  
We live on the fruits of her pillages  
She eats other queens she's very religious  
She doesn't use a fork  
I don't think I'll go back to New York
