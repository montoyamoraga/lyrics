# Strange Eyes  

Strange eyes blue clocks without hands  
Two lives lived in distant lands  
Little blue mysteries  
What did they see in me  

Strange eyes early Picassos  
Call me even when you don't  
If only from pictures  
It having been three years  

They follow me in all my dreams  
Oh god I'm still in love with you  

Strange eyes to little star charts  
Plunge knives into my poor heart  
As lovely as a tree  
They endlessly recede  

Strange eyes two little whirlpools  
Made by god to destroy fools  
Two pears of infinite cost  
Two paradises lost  

They swallow me in all my dreams  
Oh god I'm still in love with you
