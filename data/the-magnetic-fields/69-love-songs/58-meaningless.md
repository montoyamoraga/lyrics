# Meaningless

Meaningless
You mean it's all been meaningless
Every whisper and caress
Yes yes yes it was totally meaningless

Meaningless
Like when two fireflies fluoresce
Just like everything I guess
Less less less it was utterly meaningless

Even less
A little glimpse of nothingness
Sucking meaning from the rest of this mess
Yes yes yes it was thoroughly meaningless

And if some dim bulb should say
We were in love in some way
Kick all his teeth in for me
And if you feel like keeping on kicking feel free

Meaningless
Who dare say it wasn't meaningless
Shout from the rooftops and address the press
Ha ha ha it was totally meaningless

Meaningless
Meaning less than a game of chess
Just like your mother said and mother knows best
I knew it all the time but now I confess

Yes yes yes how deliciously meaningless
Yes yes yes effervescently meaningless
Yes yes yes it was beautifully meaningless
Yes yes yes it was profoundly meaningless
Yes yes yes definitively meaningless
Yes yes yes comprehensively meaningless
Yes yes yes magnificently meaningless
Yes yes yes how incredibly meaningless
Yes yes yes unprecedentedly meaningless
Yes yes yes how mindblowingly meaningless
Yes yes yes how unbelievably meaningless
Yes yes yes how infintely meaningless
