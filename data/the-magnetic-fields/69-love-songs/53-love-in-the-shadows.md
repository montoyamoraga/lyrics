# Love in the Shadows

The woman with no nose
I know where she goes
The old guy with the gold eye
We go back he and I
Don't smile
We don't do that here baby

Love in the shadows
Was never hard to find
But sometimes the moonglow
Plays tricks on your mind
Love in the shadows is the only kind

The whispers you hear
Are not sweet nothings
Let's have one more beer
And I'll tell you something
Don't laugh I think you're beautiful

Love in the shadows
Was never hard to find
But sometimes the moonglow
Plays tricks on your mind
Love in the shadows is the only kind
