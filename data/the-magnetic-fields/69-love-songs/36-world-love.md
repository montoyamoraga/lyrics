# World Love  

When the rhythm calls  
The government falls  
Here come the cops  

From Tokyo  
To Soweto  
Viva la música pop  

We are black and white  
And we dance all night  
Down at the hop  

And the letters were tall  
On the Berlin Wall  
Viva la música pop  

So if you're feeling low  
Stuck in some bardo  
I even I know the solution  
Love music wine and revolution  

Love  
Love  
Love music wine and revolution  

This too shall pass  
So raise your glass  
To change and chance  

And freedom is  
The only law  
Shall we dance  

This too shall pass  
So raise your glass  
To change and chance  

And freedom is  
The only law  
Shall we dance  

So if you're feeling low  
Stuck in some bardo  
I even I know the solution  
Love music wine and revolution  

Love  
Love  
Love music wine and revolution  

So if you're feeling low  
Stuck in some bardo  
I even I know the solution  
Love music wine and revolution
