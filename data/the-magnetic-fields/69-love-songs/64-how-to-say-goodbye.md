# How to Say Goodbye  

The only thing that I could ever feel  
I can't believe it wasn't real  
The only thing that I could ever feel  
I can't believe it wasn't real  

You can't open your mouth without telling a lie  
But baby you know how to say goodbye  

The thing I spent my whole life waiting for  
Has just walked out and locked the door  
The thing I spent my whole life waiting for  
Has just walked out and locked the door  

You can't feel a thing and you won't even try  
But baby you know how to say goodbye  

I'm overjoyed to hear about your wedding  
I'm writing you to wish you every blessing  
I'm overjoyed to hear about your wedding  
I'm writing you to wish you every blessing  

And I'm so happy I could cry  
Oh baby you know how to say goodbye  
And I'm so happy I could cry  
Oh baby you know how to say goodbye
