# It's a Crime  

It's a crime to fall in love  
Heart and mind and soul in love  
It's a crime to fall in love  
So hard so hard  

I shouldn't have bothered cause you're just like all the others  
Now I know and I won't do that again  
I should've guessed that you'd be just like all the rest  
Now I know not to go through that again  

I'm still crying all night and all day  
But if I show it someone lock me away cause  

It's a crime to fall in love  
Heart and mind and soul in love  
It's a crime to fall in love  
So hard so hard  

My mother said gently you can buy her a Bentley  
But my son she'll only drive it away  
I didn't listen cause my brain was missing  
And I only found it today  

I was a man but now I'm only a child  
And if it kills me I am going to smile cause  

It's a crime to fall in love  
Heart and mind and soul in love  
It's a crime to fall in love  
So hard so hard  

You won't be hearing from me anymore  
Cause I can't see through my tears anymore  
If it takes years to be any more than a jellyfish  
I will not tell you this because  

It's a crime to fall in love  
Heart and mind and soul in love  
It's a crime to fall in love  
So hard so hard  

So hard so hard  
So hard so hard  
So hard so hard
