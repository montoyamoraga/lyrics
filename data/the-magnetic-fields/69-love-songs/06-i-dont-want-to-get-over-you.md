# I Don't Want to Get Over You  

I don't want to get over you  
I guess I could take a sleeping pill  
And sleep at will  
And not have to go through what I go through  
I guess I should take Prozac right  
And just smile all night  
At somebody new  
Somebody not too bright  
But sweet and kind  
Who would try to get you off my mind  
I could leave this agony behind  
Which is just what I'd do  
If I wanted to  
But I don't want to get over you  

Cause I don't want to get over love  
I could listen to my therapist  
Pretend you don't exist  
And not have to dream of what I dream of  
I could listen to all my friends  
And go out again  
And pretend it's enough  
Or I could make a career of being blue  
I could dress in black and read Camus  
Smoke clove cigarettes and drink vermouth  
Like I was seventeen  
That would be a scream  
But I don't want to get over you
