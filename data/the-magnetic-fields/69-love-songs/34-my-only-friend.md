# My Only Friend  

Billie you're a miracle  
And god knows I need one  
Sing me something terrible  
That even dawn may come  
You and me  
We don't believe in happy endings  

Hey lady day  
Can you save my life this time  
Can you cry so beautifully  
You make my troubles rhyme  

Hey lady day  
Can you save my life again  
My only love has gone away  
Will you be my only friend  

Billie you're a genius  
Enough to be a fool  
A fool to gamble everything  
And never know the rules  
Some of us can only live  
In songs of love and trouble  
Some of us can only live in bubbles  

Hey lady day  
Can you save my life this time  
Can you cry so beautifully  
You make my troubles rhyme  

Hey lady day  
Can you save my life again  
My only love has gone away  
Will you be my only friend
