# A Chicken With Its Head Cut Off

Eligible not too stupid
Intelligible and cute as cupid
Knowledgeable but not always right
Salvageable and free for the night

Well my heart's running around like a chicken with its head cut off
All around the barnyard falling in and out of love
The poor thing's blind as a bat
Getting up falling down getting up
Who'd fall in love with a chicken with its head cut off

Whoa Nellie

My wife doesn't understand me
Many dozens hope to land me
I'm for free love and I'm in free fall
This could be love or nothing at all

Well my heart's running around like a chicken with its head cut off
All around the barnyard falling in and out of love
The poor thing's blind as a bat
Getting up falling down getting up
Who'd fall in love with a chicken with its head cut off

We don't have to be stars exploding in the night
Or electric eels under the covers
We don't have to be anything quite so unreal
Let's just be lovers

Well my heart's running around like a chicken with its head cut off
All around the barnyard falling in and out of love
The poor thing's blind as a bat
Getting up falling down getting up
Who'd fall in love with a chicken with its head cut off

It ain't pretty
