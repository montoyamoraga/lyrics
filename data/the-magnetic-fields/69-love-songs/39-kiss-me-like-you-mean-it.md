# Kiss Me Like You Mean It  

He is my lord  
He is my savior  
And he rewards  
My good behavior  
My secret soul  
I know he's seen it  

He says come here baby  
And kiss me like you mean it  
He calls me baby  
Says kiss me like you mean it  

He is my light  
And my salvation  
He's always right  
He's always patient  
I pinch myself  
It's like I'm dreaming it   

He says come here baby  
And kiss me like you mean it  
He calls me baby  
Says kiss me like you mean it  

He is my love  
He's always been it  

He says come here baby  
And kiss me like you mean it  
He calls me baby  
Says kiss me like you mean it
