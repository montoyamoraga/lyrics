# The Death of Ferdinand de Saussure  

I met Ferdinand de Saussure  
On a night like this  
On love he said I'm not so sure  
I even know what it is  

No understanding no closure  
It is a nemesis  
You can't use a bulldozer  
To study orchids he said so  

We don't know anything  
You don't know anything  
I don't know anything  
About love  

And we are nothing  
You are nothing  
I am nothing  
Without love  

I'm just a great composer  
And not a violent man  
But I lost my composure  
and I shot Ferdinand  

Crying it's well and kosher  
To say you don't understand  
But this is for Holland Dozier Holland  
His last words were  

We don't know anything  
You don't know anything  
I don't know anything  
About love  

And we are nothing  
You are nothing  
I am nothing  
Without love  

His fading words were  

We don't know anything  
You don't know anything  
I don't know anything  
About love  

And we are nothing  
You are nothing  
I am nothing  
Without love
