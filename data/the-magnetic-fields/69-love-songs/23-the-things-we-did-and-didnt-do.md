# The Things We Did and Didn't Do  

All the things I knew I didn't know  
And didn't want to know  
That you told me just to tell me  
Later that you'd told me so  
Come flooding back to me now  
Come on  
Come flooding back to me now  

All the things you said you'd never say  
And you said anyway  
The things we did and didn't do  
The things we did and didn't do  
Come flooding back to me now
