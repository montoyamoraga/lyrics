# Yeah! Oh, Yeah!

Are you out of love with me
Are you longing to be free
Do I drive you up a tree
Yeah oh yeah

Do I drive you up the wall
Do you dread every phone call
Can you not stand me at all
Yeah oh yeah

Though I need you more than air
Is it true you just don't care
Are you having an affair
Yeah oh yeah

When we met I thought money was everything
So I let you buy the house the cars the ring
But I can't take your perpetual whining
And you can't sing

Yeah oh yeah

I thought if we lived apart
We could make a brand new start
Do you want to break my heart
Yeah oh yeah

I've enjoyed making you miserable for years
Found peace of mind in playing on your fears
How I loved to catch your gold and silver fears
But now my dear

What a dark and dreary life
Are you reaching for a knife
Could you really kill your wife
Yeah oh yeah

Oh I die I die I die
So it's over you and I
Was my whole life just a lie
Yeah oh yeah
