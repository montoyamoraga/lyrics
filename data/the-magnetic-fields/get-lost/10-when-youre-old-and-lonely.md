# When You're Old and Lonely  

When you're old and lonely  
You will wish you'd married me  
I could build a fire for you  
And bring you cakes and tea  

When you're cold and hungry
I'll be waiting by the phone  
You can call me up and tell me  
How you're all alone all alone  

When you're old and lonely  
Ad the rush of life is past  
Days go by too slowly and  
The years go by too fast  

When your golden loneliness  
Is heavier than stone  
You can call me up and say  
My god I'm all alone all alone
