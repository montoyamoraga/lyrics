# The Desperate Things You Made Me Do  

Time provides the rope but love will tie the slipknot  
And I will be the chair you kick away  
You don't even like anything you like or the people you know  
And all of your reasons to stay alive died  

I dedicate this song to you  
For all the desperate things you made me do  
I'd like to beat you black and blue  
For all the agony you have put me through  

Front seat stained with love a back seat full of bibles  
Purloined from the drawers of lost motels  
They say when you're older you'll understand you know it's a lie  
Cause you've got a twisted and mangled heart  

I dedicate this song to you  
For all the desperate things you made me do  
I'd like to beat you black and blue  
For all the agony you have put me through  

Down route sixty six you pilfered love and green stamps  
WC Fields with Mae West in your eyes  
They say every clock's a blunt instrument crushing the skull  
But you've got a vice to rest your head in  

I dedicate this song to you  
For all the desperate things you made me do  
I'd like to beat you black and blue  
For all the agony you have put me through
