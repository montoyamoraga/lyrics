# Famous  

I know you've tried  
I know you've cried  
I know you've died  
A little inside but  

Baby you could be famous  
You could see your marble face all around  
Baby you could be famous  
If you could just get out of this town  
Just get out of this town now  

Baby you could be famous  
You could sell the world a new look and sound  
Baby you could be famous  
If you could just get out of this town  
Just get out of this town now  

You sold your soul  
To rock and roll  
Gave up control  
But here's your loophole  

Baby you could be famous  
You could see your marble face all around  
Baby you could be famous  
If you could just get out of this town  
Just get out of this town now  

Baby you could be famous  
You could sell the world a new look and sound  
Baby you could be famous  
If you could just get out of this town  
Just get out of this town now  

You are the queen  
Of every scene  
You are the king  
Of everything  

Baby you could be famous  
You could see your marble face all around  
Baby you could be famous  
If you could just get out of this town  
Just get out of this town now  

Baby you could be famous  
You could sell the world a new look and sound  
Baby you could be famous  
If you could just get out of this town  
Just get out of this town now
