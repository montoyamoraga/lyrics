# You and Me and the Moon

Brian Wilson nineteen sixty and vine
Summer kisses
In a Pendleton shirt and gentle words
Granted wishes

When you look in my eyes I go soft inside
And the sound of your voice sends shivers up my spine
And at the slightest touch we're in love
You and me and the moon
You and me and the moon

In a cool gay bar where the people are
Entertaining
When the sun clock in we'll still be talking
And champagning

Underneath the strobe lights we can dance all night
I'm a little bit shy you're easy on the eye
And at the slightest touch we're in love
You and me and the moon
You and me and the moon

When you look in my eyes I go soft inside
And the sound of your voice sends shivers up my spine
And at the slightest touch we're in love
You and me and the moon
You and me and the moon
You and me and the moon
You and me and the moon
