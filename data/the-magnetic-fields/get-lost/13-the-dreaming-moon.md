# The Dreaming Moon

With an ivory pipe and a cummerbund
In the dead of night on the Autobahn
With the long ago on the radio
And the dreaming moon

We were young and in love in a burning town
But the fire went out I'm alone again now
And I finally know how cool to be cold
With the dreaming moon

I'll begin again with another new name
And a whole new life full of fortune and fame
But in the hundredth year I'll be right back here
With the dreaming moon

The dreaming moon
The dreaming moon
The dreaming moon
The dreaming moon
