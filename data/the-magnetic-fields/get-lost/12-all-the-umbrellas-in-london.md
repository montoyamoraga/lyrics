# All the Umbrellas in London  

If I live through the night I could be all right  
It'll make a good song or something  
I've been trying to give myself reasons to live  
But I really can't think of one thing  

I drive around  
I walk around in circles  
Cause I've got no sense of direction  
I guess I've got no sense at all  

All the umbrellas in London couldn't stop this rain  
And all the dope in New York couldn't kill this pain  
And all the money in Tokyo couldn't make me stay  
All the umbrellas in London couldn't stop this rain  

I don't cry anymore I walk out of the door  
And I usually keep on walking  
I may sit in a bar where the cocktails are  
But I really don't feel like talking  

I ride around  
And let the darkness fall  
Cause I've got a sense of perfection  
And nothing makes much sense at all  

All the umbrellas in London couldn't stop this rain  
And all the dope in New York couldn't kill this pain  
And all the money in Tokyo couldn't make me stay  
All the umbrellas in London couldn't stop this rain
