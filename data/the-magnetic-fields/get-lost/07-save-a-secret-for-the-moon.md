# Save a Secret for the Moon

I know all the names of your tears
The numbers of those lonely years
I know all the someone someday's
Don't believe them anyway

When you love someone
You can always tell the sun
It will be twilight soon
Save a secret for the moon

In a darkened room
Write it on a black balloon
Then watch it fade from view
Save a secret for the moon

I can show you sadder poetry
Than you ever dreamed there could be
I know all the saddest people
Most of them are dead now

When you love someone
You can always tell the sun
And it will be twilight soon
Save a secret for the moon

In a darkened room
Write it on a black balloon
Then watch it fade from view
Save a secret for the moon

When you love someone
You can always tell the sun
And it will be twilight soon
Save a secret for the moon

In a darkened room
Write it on a black balloon
Then watch it fade from view
Save a secret for the moon
