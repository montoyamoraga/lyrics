# Don't Look Away  

Don't look away  
I don't think I could stand it  
So don't look away  
Cause my heart couldn't handle it  
There's a fire in your eyes  
And it's melting the ice in my heart  

Don't blink an eye  
They're so beautiful open  
Just let them cry  
Or the spell will be broken  
And moments in your gaze  
Have been turning to days in my heart  

We've never met  
And yet we're in love  
Never forget  
One look is enough just as long as you  

Don't look away  
We can never be lovers  
There's one chance to take  
There won't be any others  
I'll be spending my life  
With your eyes like a knife in my heart
