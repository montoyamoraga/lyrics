# With Whom to Dance?  

Moons in June  
I've given up on that stuff
Arms have charms  
But I've no hope of falling in love  

The rest of life pales in significance  
I'm looking for somebody with whom to dance  
With whom to dance with whom to dance  
I'm looking for somebody with whom to dance  

Rings and strings  
What use I have for these things  
Bells and carousels  
I'd just be fooling myself  

The rest of life pales in significance  
I'm looking for somebody with whom to dance  
With whom to dance with whom to dance  
I'm looking for somebody with whom to dance  

And you you look like heaven  
An angel who stepped from a dream  
Seven hundred and seventy seven times  
Lovelier than anything I have ever seen  

The rest of life pales in significance  
I'm looking for somebody with whom to dance  
With whom to dance with whom to dance  
I'm looking for somebody with whom to dance
