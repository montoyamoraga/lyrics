# Smoke and Mirrors  

Someone else's world goes by  
As my train runs through this night  
Someone else's rain comes down  
But no rain can touch me now  

Smoke and mirrors  
Special effects  
A little fear  
A little sex  
That's all love is  
Behind the tears  
Smoke and mirrors  

We were foolish you and I  
But there's no reason to cry  
We put on a lovely show  
But that's all I had to go  

Smoke and mirrors  
Special effects  
A little fear  
A little sex  
That's all love is  
Behind the tears  
Smoke and mirrors  

I don't know the station's names  
I'll spend my life on this train  

Smoke and mirrors  
Special effects  
A little fear  
A little sex  
That's all love is  
Behind the tears  
Smoke and mirrors
