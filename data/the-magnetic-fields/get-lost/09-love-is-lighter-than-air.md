# Love Is Lighter Than Air  

Summer summer summer  
Slowly turned into fall  
Me and my baby doll  
Never went to the beach  

Somewhere somewhere somewhere  
Was a place we could run  
On the sand with the sun  
Always just out of reach  

Somewhere sunny summer's  
Marching to a different drummer singing  
Summer summer summer's  
Gonna turn into fall  
You and your baby doll  
Better go to the beach cause  

Love is lighter than air  
It floats away if you let go  
Love is lighter than air  
It rises through the falling snow  

A crime crime crime  
Sin and illness is time  
Neither reason nor rhyme  
Can obstruct his bad dance  

The nasty little swine  
Slipped us mickeys in wine  
Wove his hair into twine  
And then tied our hands  

We're forced to watch him wiggle  
And endure his fulsome giggle  
And his mime mime mime  
Unforgivable mime  
Our one chance to climb  
Into blimps of romance cause  

Love is lighter than air  
It floats away if you let go  
Love is lighter than air  
It rises through the falling snow  

Love is lighter than air  
It floats away if you let go  
Love is lighter than air  
It rises through the falling snow  

Love is lighter than air  
It floats away if you let go  
Love is lighter than air  
It rises through the falling snow
