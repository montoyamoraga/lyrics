# Falling in Love With the Wolfboy  

She can make you feel like filth  
She can make you feel like a star  
She will scratch til her hand is bloody  
But she'll love you more for the scar  

She remembers the recent past  
She's something the cat dragged in  
She's a trollop in paisley so  
Take her down to the woods  

Where the wolfboy lives  
So the villagers say  
And the three of you evaporate into the night  
Til you both fall in love with him  

With a face like an African mask  
And the strength of ten men when she's wrong  
She's in charge in the world at large  
And her novels are all very long  

She belongs on the astral plane  
She's probably a hologram  
Put her back in the padded cell  
Take her down to the woods  

Where the wolfboy lives  
So the villagers say  
And the three of you evaporate into the night  
Til you both fall in love with him  

So you'll dress head to foot in lam√©  
And you'll dance in December snow  
When the sky turns to wine you'll embrace  
And forget everything that you know  

She can tell you the will of the gods  
Butter won't melt in her mouth but you will  
Don't bother to ask her name  
Take her down to the woods  

Where the wolfboy lives  
So the villagers say  
And the three of you evaporate into the night  
Til you both fall in love with him
