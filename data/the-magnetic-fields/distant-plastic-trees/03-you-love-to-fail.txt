# You Love to Fail

Maybe tomorrow I'll see love in your eyes
And mine will dry
Maybe tomorrow we can learn how to fly
On these nasty little wings

And I wanna take you out but you always refuse
Cause you only play the games that you know you can lose
You love to fail that's all you love

We don't know why you've been gone
Somebody said you're on the run
You're living where wild horses run
Well hey whatever turns you on

And I wanna take you out but you always refuse
Cause you only play the games that you know you can lose
You love to fail that's all you love

I'll be your confidante
Come and go as you please
I'll honor and protect my
Wagner in dungarees

And I wanna take you out but you always refuse
Cause you only play the games that you know you can lose
You love to fail that's all you love

And I wanna take you out but you always refuse
Cause you only play the games that you know you can lose
You love to fail that's all you love
