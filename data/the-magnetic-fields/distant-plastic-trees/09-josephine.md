# Josephine  

If I were Napoleon  
You could be my Josephine  
We could go to drive-in films  
In my red convertible  

If I were Napoleon  
I might be in magazines  
I'd write some science fiction  
Science fiction about you  

You could be my Josephine  
Just you and your chaperone  
Let you be my Josephine  
Josephine  

If I were Napoleon  
You could be my lady love  
Look into my soft blue eyes  
Run your fingers through my hair  

If I were Napoleon  
You could be my turtle dove  
Living out in Corsica  
In our summer cottages  

And you could be my Josephine  
And we could be Siamese twins  
Let you be my Josephine  
Josephine
