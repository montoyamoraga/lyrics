# 100,000 Fireflies

I have a mandolin
I play it all night long
It makes me want to kill myself

I also have a dobro
Made in some mountain range
Sounds like a mountain range in love

But when I turn up the tone
On my electric guitar

I'm afraid of the dark without you close to me
I'm afraid of the dark without you close to me

I went out to the forest and caught
A hundred thousand fireflies
As they ricochet around the room
They remind me of your starry eyes
Someone else might not have made me so sad
But this is the worst night I ever had

Cause I'm afraid of the dark without you close to me
I'm afraid of the dark without you close to me
Always was

You won't be happy with me
But give me one more chance
You won't be happy anyway

Why do we still live here
In this repulsive town
All our friends are in New York

Why do we keep shrieking
When we mean soft things
We should be whispering all the time
