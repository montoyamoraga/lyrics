# Kings

All day
Snow covered us
Night time
It was always night

The people on the street
Were made of meat
Black girl
Trucks ran us down
Blue boy

The people on the sidewalk were traced in chalk
Whale embryos filled your enormous room
Screech owl kachinas built your spiritual room

We were kings
Kings

We were kings
Kings
