# Living in an Abandoned Firehouse With You  

You're in your own little world  
An expensive birdcage  
Like a plastic baby  
In a Fabergé egg  

I saw you today  
At the Café Blasé  
And thought of the nights  
When we had firefights  

Nameless seaside ghost town  
That's where I go when I see the moon  
Living in an abandoned firehouse with you  

You're in your own little head  
In a field of sunflowers  
And there's blood in your mouth  
And there's rats all over town  

Take me out to the beach  
And I'll tell you my secret name  
Take me under the sea  
And we'll derail the trains  

Let's run away  
Into the cave  
I still love you  
I still love you  
Baby  

You're in your little box  
With ribbons in your hair  
And there's dust in your mouth  
And worms in the air  

Hideous city of unknown words  
That's where I live when I go to sleep  
In an abandoned firehouse with you  

Take me out to the beach  
And I'll tell you my secret name  
Take me under the sea  
And we'll derail the trains  

Let's run away  
Into the trees  
I still love you  
I still love you  
Baby
