# Railroad Boy

I will not sing your ugly song
I won't put on your ugly play
I cannot join your ugly priesthood
And if I die I won't come home
Railroad boy of mine

I bought you crows and candelabra
And I went moth-eating with you
I held you down when you had seizures
And read to you at bedtime
Railroad boy of mine

We went to see a beaver damn
We went to see a coral reef
But life is more than going to see things
And that's too bad
Railroad boy of mine
Railroad boy of mine
