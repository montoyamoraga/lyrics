# Smoke Signals

Well you've got a really long name
It won't fit on any forms
You gave me all your mirrors
And they made me deformed

You're sending smoke signals
I know your secret code

We travel in the plaid van
And we give our puppet show
And we picnic in the winter
On maple syrup and snow

You're sending smoke signals
I know your secret code

Well you made a molotov cocktail
And you threw it on the ground
And it sent us flying
And now we're flying about

You're sending smoke signals
I know your secret code
