# Tar-Heel Boy

Tar-heel boy sings a song
About a girl who ain't coming home
By and by by and by
By and by by and by

She worked too long in the mill
She's gone to those rolling hills
In the sky in the sky
In the sky in the sky

We're barely off mama's milk
And we're locked in here weaving silk
We can't buy we can't buy
We can't buy we can't buy

While you've been off in Oregon
I've been drinking here all alone
All night long all day long
All night long all day long

They shot a nine year old boy
For a hundred dollars
