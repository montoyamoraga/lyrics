# Babies Falling

Where the workers stand in querulous rows
Awaiting dislocation
I will be there too

When you're cashing in your food stamps
When you're sleeping in a cattle train
I'll be with you

Pushing up against the ticket counter window
Face against the glass
Bleeding from the waist
And kissing to be chaste

It is said that those who will not rest
Have been cursed to tramp like soldiers
Through the marshes

Or that blessed are the ones who leave
The stage like babies falling fast asleep

So I twice am cursed and twice am stuck
Affixed to this corner of the earth

That old river keeps on rolling
But the old man doesn't see it
He just stands there with his eyes closed
Asking where'd you go
Where'd you go

So wherever you may sleep tonight
Be it bed or bedrock home or open field

When your breathing slows and your eyes are closed
When you begin to yield

Then whatever you have taken as your pillow
May it serve as mine as well

Underneath the weeping willow
I will wait for you forever
My eyes forever closed
Asking where'd you go
Where'd you go
