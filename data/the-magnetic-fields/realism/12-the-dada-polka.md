# The Dada Polka  

People of Earth when you dance  
Dance the dada polka  
Life is only a dream  

When in the mood for romance  
Dance the dada polka  
Be as cute as you seem  

Gyrate like a gyroscope  
Collide like a kaleidoscope  
Freeze  

Do something  
Anything  
Do something  
Please  

People of earth don't just stand there  
The dada polka  
Is as fun as it sounds  

Move the hips and hands when the band  
Plays the dada polka  
You may lose a few pounds  

Gyrate like a gyroscope  
Collide like a kaleidoscope  
Change  

Do something  
Anything  
Do something  
Strange  

People of Mars you too must  
Do the dada polka  
It's the meaning of life  

Fill any partner with lust  
Do the dada polka  
Soon there'll be a new wife   

Gyrate like a gyroscope  
Collide like a kaleidoscope  
Do  

Do something  
Anything  
Do something  
Blue  

Do something  
Anything  
Do something a little out of character  
It won't kill you  

Do something  
Anything  
Do something  
True
