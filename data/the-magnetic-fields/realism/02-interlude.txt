# Interlude

The moon blue ray of magical light
Festoon her face this beautiful light
The moon her only lover
But soon even that will be over

So they climb high
In the violet sky
And they dance

And he'll whisper
All his mysteries to her
As they dance

He will fall
In love
Poor fellow
Just when all
Above
Turns yellow
And the dawn
Breaks his heart

He will fall
In love
Poor fellow
Just when all
Above
Turns yellow
And the dawn
Breaks his heart
