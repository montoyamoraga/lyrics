# Painted Flower  

I'm just a painted flower on silk brocade  
Left in the sun I will slowly fade  
Fade to nothing like I'd never been made  
Like I'd never been made  

I'm just a painted flower a frozen bloom  
Left alone in some forgotten room  
A fly in amber I pose in my tomb  
I pose in my tomb  

I'm only drops of paint in a silver frame  
Without an aim and without a name  
Gathering dust every day just the same  
Every day just the same
