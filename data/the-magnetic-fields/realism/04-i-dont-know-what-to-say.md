# I Don't Know What to Say

I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say

I could say I want you that would be a bore
Maybe in a font you haven't seen before
I could say I'll haunt you til your dying day
I could tease and taunt you but what would I say

See
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say

I could say I crave you still you little brat
I could rant and rave you know I can do that
I could say I gave you everything I have
I could say I'll save you you might think me mad

So
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say

I could try and lead you down the garden path
I could say I'll feed you you can do the math
I could say I need you offer you a ring
I'll be guaranteed you don't believe a thing

So
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say

I could try to shave you off the nearest cliff
I could say I love you
