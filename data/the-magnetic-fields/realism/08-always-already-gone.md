# Always Already Gone

I tried hard to keep you
I needn't have tried
It seems you'd decided
When did you decide
So this is the last time
I cry in the dawn
It seems you were always
Always already gone

You never were happy
You had to be free
You took all the freedom
You needed from me
Then you and your freedom
Flew thither and yon
You're free to be always
Always already gone

I couldn't have dreamed you
But I might as well
You leave me with only
A story to tell
But at the beginning
Our story is done
Because you were always
Always already gone
Always already gone
