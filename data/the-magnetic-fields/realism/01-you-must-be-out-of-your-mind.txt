# You Must Be Out Of Your Mind

You think I'll run not walk to you
Why would I want to talk to you
I want you crawling back to me
Down on your knees yeah
Like an appendectomy
Sans anesthesia

If you think you can leave the past behind
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can simply press rewind
You must be out of your mind son
You must be out of your mind

You want what you turned off turned on
You call it sunset now it's dawn
You can't go round just saying stuff
Because it's pretty
And I no longer drink enough
To think you're witty

If you think you can leave the past behind
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can simply press rewind
You must be out of your mind son
You must be out of your mind

You want to kindle that old flame
I don't remember your real name
It must be something scandalous
Lurks in your shallows
If you need a Santa Claus
To buy your gallows

If you think you can leave the past behind
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can simply press rewind
You must be out of your mind son
You must be out of your mind
You must be out of your mind son
You must be out of your mind
