# Seduced and Abandoned

Seduced and abandoned 
And baby makes two
Baby abandoned by you
Seduced and abandoned
And what can I do
I think I might drink a few

Seduced with a grin
I was all taken in
Taken in sin and in shame
Seduced by a smile
I walked down the aisle
Then waited a while
No one came

Seduced and abandoned 
And baby makes two
Baby abandoned by you
Seduced and abandoned
And what can I do
I think I might drink a few

Abandoned to weep
I collapsed in a heap
Dutifully sleeping all day
Abandoned to die
I did nothing but cry
In my one ply neglig√©e

Seduced and abandoned 
And baby makes two
Baby abandoned by you
Seduced and abandoned
And what can I do
I think I might drink a few

Yes I think I might drink a few
And maybe the baby will too
