# Walk a Lonely Road  

When I was a little boy  
Way out in the wood  
I had neither friend nor toy  
Never knew I could  

When I found this lonely road  
Off I walked for good  
When I was a little boy  
Way out in the wood  

Walk a lonely road with me  
I will walk with you  
Half as lonely we will be  
When we walk as two  

If the road goes straight uphill  
We'll admire the view  
Walk a lonely road with me  
I will walk with you  

When I was a little girl  
On the lonesome plain  
I had neither pal nor pearl  
Mostly wind and rain  

One day I set out along  
A little winding lane  
When I was a little girl  
On the lonesome plain  

Walk a lonely road with me  
I will walk with you  
Half as lonely we will be  
When we walk as two  

If the road goes straight uphill  
We'll admire the view  
Walk a lonely road with me  
I will walk with you
