# The Doll's Tea Party  

At the doll's tea party we fritter away  
The long afternoon of a warmer summer day  
With extended pinkies and pink cloisonn√©  
Cups and saucers and pots and a Liberty tray  

That's why we take our tea  
At the doll's tea party  

At the doll's tea party we twitter along  
We prattle and tattle on who's done whom wrong  
On who's in who's out and who's best at mahjong  
Oh and where to buy fabulous things for a song  

That's why we take our tea  
At the doll's tea party  

But the cakes  
Ah the cakes are why everyone's there  
They are not dietetic in any way  
Dare to try one and you'll have a few pounds to spare  
Try another one what do you care  

At the doll's we're all in our glittering best  
There will be a test on who's best and worst dressed  
But we won't have it said we're fashion obsessed  
We're just prettier ladies than most of the rest  

That's why we take our tea  
At the doll's tea party
