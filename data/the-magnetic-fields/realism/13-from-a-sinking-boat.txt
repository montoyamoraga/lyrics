# From a Sinking Boat

In the middle of the night with a sickening sound
This little boat ran aground
The mast is twisted the hull is breached
One high tide and it'll be beached

If I could walk I'd walk away 
But I haven't slept since yesterday
The ink is sinking the page is blurred
And I can't read a single word

But I know that I love you know that I wrote
My last words to you from a sinking boat
