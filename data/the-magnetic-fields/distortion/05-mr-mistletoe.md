# Mr. Mistletoe  

I walk alone around the town  
I used to walk with you  
I watch the lonely snow come down  
Down Seventh Avenue  
Now dreadful decorations deck the air  
And mistletoe is hanging everywhere  
But you no longer care  

Oh mister mistletoe  
Hanging above  
Please go away  
I've got no one to love  

Oh mister mistletoe  
Wither and die  
You useless weed  
For no one have I  

Oh mister mistletoe  
How very rude  
Couldn't you tell
I'm not in the mood  

Oh mister mistletoe  
Go find your tree  
Didn't you know  
There's no Christmas for me  

Oh mister mistletoe  
Go find your tree
Didn't you know  
There's no Christmas for me
