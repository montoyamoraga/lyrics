# Drive on, Driver

Drive on driver
There's no one home
We've waited hours
She didn't come
It's such a pretty little ring
But it doesn't mean anything
Drive on

Drive on driver
And don't you cry
I gave her everything
Money could buy
I always said that girl
Deserved the whole wide world
Drive on

And take me to the airport
I need to be extremely far away
So I can forget about her
I might forget about her someday

Drive on Randy
It's all gone wrong
Have some brandy
Sing me a song
Something soft and low
Can we please just go
Drive on

Something soft and low
Can we please just go
Drive on
