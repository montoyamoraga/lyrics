# Till the Bitter End

Through sleet and snow and storm and hail
Through every degradation and betrayal
Past rhyme and reason and beyond the pale
Darling
I will love you till the bitter end
And all the biter moments till then

Through time and tomb and Tim and Tom
Through pro and con and quid pro quo and qualm
Through tidal wave and asteroid and bomb
Darling
I will love you till the bitter end
And all the biter moments till then

And when you charms begin to fade
And when you feel old and afraid
I'll scratch beneath your shoulder blade and whisper

My love is deeper than I show
Remember what I said through sleet and snow
So even though I know you have to go
Darling
I will love you till the bitter end
And all the biter moments till then
