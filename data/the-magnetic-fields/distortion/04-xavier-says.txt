# Xavier Says

Xavier says ha ha ha
We have nothing in common
See you around ta ta
Slink back to your abominable lover
Zsa Zsa before I blow your cover
Tra la la

Zsa Zsa's scene tacky queen
You think there's no one but you
Get your crass little ass
Out and don't make me cut you
With how much you
Talk you'd think that 
Someone else was listening
Want a drink miss thing

Slow gin fizz says Xavier
Zsa Zsa orders and drinks come
Here it is teddy bear
To your health you ratfink scum
Xavier weezes I forgot
Before each line he sneezes
Quite a lot
Quite a lot
