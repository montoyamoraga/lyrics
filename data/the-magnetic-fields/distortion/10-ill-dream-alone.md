# I'll Dream Alone  

Long  
And lonely nights  
I've waited for you  
To put things to rights  
Leaving you to do  
Your thing without  
Disturbance from me  
Somehow I doubt you'll ever be  

Back  
I'll keep your things  
If you ever need them  
The phone still rings  
And now that you're free  
Of me at last  
Your time is your own  
Go have a blast  

And I'll dream alone without you  
I'll dream alone if I must  
Because I guess our little castle in the sky  
Just turned to dust  
So I'll dream alone that's showbiz  
I'll dream alone from here in  
And I'll be trying not to dream  
Of what was once and might have been  
If only I'd known  
I'll dream alone  

Dreams  
We had a few  
But what kind of dream  
Beats you black and blue  
I wanted to scream  
Don't go away  
But nothing came out  
All I could say is  

I'll dream alone without you  
I'll dream alone if I must  
Because I guess our little castle in the sky  
Just turned to dust  
So I'll dream alone that's showbiz  
I'll dream alone from here in  
And I'll be trying not to dream  
Of what was once and might have been  
If only I'd known  
I'll dream alone
