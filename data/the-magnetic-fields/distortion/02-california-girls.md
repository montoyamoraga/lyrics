# California Girls  

See them on their big bright screen
Tan and blonde and seventeen  
Eating nonfood keeps them mean  
But they're young forever  
If they must grow up  
They marry dukes and earls  
I hate California girls  

They ain't broke so they put on airs  
The faux folks sans derrieres  
They breathe coke and have affairs  
With each passing rock star  
They come on like squares  
Then get off like squirrels  
I hate California girls  

Looking down their perfect noses  
At me and my kind  
Do they think we won't  
Well never mind  

Laughing through their perfect teeth  
At everyone I know  
Do they think we won't  
Get up and go  

So I have planned my grand attacks  
I will stand behind their backs  
With my brand new battle axe  
Then they will taste my wrath  
They will hear me say  
As the pavement whirls  
I hate California girls  

They will hear me say  
As the pavement whirls  
I hate California girls  

They will hear me say  
As the pavement whirls  
I hate California girls  

They will hear me say  
As the pavement whirls  
I hate California girls  

They will hear me say
As the pavement whirls
"I hate California girls..."

They will hear me say
As the pavement whirls
"I hate California girls..."
