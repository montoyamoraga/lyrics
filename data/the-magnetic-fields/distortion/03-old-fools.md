# Old Fools  

Old fools dancing  
Old fools who believe that they can dance and sing  
And fall in love  
After all love  

Old wines old shoes  
Old lines who'd have thought they would ever reuse  
Like I love you  
Surprise I love you  

Flowers long drives  
Old fools new lives  
Old fools dancing  
Old rules take a backseat to new romancing  
Long drives flowers  
Old fools new lovers
