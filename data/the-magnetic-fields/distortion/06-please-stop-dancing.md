# PLease Stop Dancing  

Please stop dancing in my head  
I have cried till I'm half dead  
Please stop dancing in my head  

Please stop dancing in my mind  
I have cried till I'm half blind  
Please stop dancing in my mind  

Please stop dancing in my heart  
I can't seem to make it art  
Please stop dancing in my heart  

Please stop dancing in my soul  
I can't make it rock and roll  
Please stop dancing in my soul  

Please stop dancing in my sleep  
I can't make it twang and beep  
Please stop dancing in my sleep  

Please stop dancing in my eyes  
I can't make it pretty lies  
Please stop dancing in my eyes  

Please stop dancing in my blood  
It will blind blowing no one good  
Please stop dancing in my blood  

Please stop dancing in my life  
I will never be your wife  
Please stop dancing in my life
