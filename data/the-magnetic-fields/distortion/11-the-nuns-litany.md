# The Nun's Litany  

I want to be a playboy's bunny  
I'd do whatever they asked me to  
I'd meet people with lots of money  
And men would love me like I loved you  

I want to be a topless waitress  
I want my mother to shed one tear  
I'd throw away this old sedate dress  
Slip into something a tad more sheer  

I want to be an artist's model  
An odalisque au naturel  
I should be good at spin the bottle  
While I've still got something left to sell  

I want to be a cobra dancer  
With Little Willy between my thighs  
I may not find a cure for cancer  
But I'll meet plenty of single guys  

I want to be a brothel worker  
I've always been treated like one  
If I could be a backstreet lurker  
I'd make more money and have more fun  

I want to be a dominatrix  
Which isn't like me but I can dream  
Learn S and M and all those gay tricks  
And men will pay me to make them scream  

I want to be a porno starlet  
For that I'll wait till mama's dead  
I'd see my name in lights of scarlet  
And get to spend every day in bed  

I want to be a tattooed lady  
Dedicated as I am to art  
Characters bold complex and shady  
Will write my memoirs across my heart
