# Courtesans  

Well courtesans shed no tears  
When you leave them high and dry  
They just go on  
They just go on  
To the next guy  

Cause courtesans only want  
Compensation for their time  
A few kind words  
A few kind words  
They need not rhyme  

A sable coat maybe a hat  
Oh I wish I could be like that  

But courtesans are not like me  
They don't take love very hard  
Their hearts are free  
Their hearts are free  
How avant garde  

If no one loves them when they're old  
They'll sit upon their chains of gold  

You say you'll love them till you die  
And they don't care if it's a lie  

Cause courtesans don't believe  
In anybody but themselves  
And Santa Claus  
And Santa Claus  
And his twelve elves
