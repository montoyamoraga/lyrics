# Too Drunk to Dream

Sober life is a prison
Shit faced it is a blessing
Sober nobody wants you
Shit faced they're all undressing

Oh sober it's ever darker
Shit faced the moon is nearer
Sober you're old and ugly
Shit faced who needs a mirror

Oh sober you're a cromagnon
Shit faced you're very clever
Sober you never should be
Shit faced now and forever

I've got to get too drunk to dream
Cause dreaming only makes me blue
I've got to get too drunk to dream
Because I only dream of you

I've got to get too pissed to miss you
Or I'll never get to sleep
I've got to drink wine not to pine for you
And god knows that ain't cheap

I know you think I'm insane
I know it's not appealing
But til I'm feeling no pain
Guess what I'll be feeling

I've got to get too drunk to dream
Because dreaming only makes me blue
I've got to get too drunk to dream
Because I only dream of you

I've got to get too fried to cry
Or I'll be crying all night long
I've got to get too high to sigh
Oh my god where did I go wrong

So why do I get plastered
And why I am so lonely
It's you you heartless bastard
You're my one and only

I've got to get too drunk to dream
Because dreaming only makes me blue
I've got to get too drunk to dream
Because I only dream of you

I've got to get too pissed to miss you
Or I'll never get to sleep
I've got to drink wine not to pine for you
And god knows that ain't cheap
And god knows that ain't cheap
