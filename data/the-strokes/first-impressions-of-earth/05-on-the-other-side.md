# On the Other Side  

I'm tired  
of everyone  
I know  

Of everyone  
I see  
On the street  
And on T.V.  

On the other side  
On the other side  
Nobody's waiting for me  
On the other side  

I hate them all  
I hate them all  
I hate myself  
For hating them  

So I'll drink some more  
I love them all  
I'll drink even more  
I'll hate them even more  
Than I did before  

On the other side  
On the other side  
Nobody's waiting for me  
On the other side  

I remember when you came  
You taught me how to sing  
Now it seems so far away  
You taught me how to sing  

I'm tired  
Of being   
So judgmental  
Of everyone  

I will not go to sleep  
I will train my eyes to see  
That my mind is as blind  
As a branch on a tree  

On the other side  
On the other side  
I know what's waiting for me  
On the other side  

On the other side  
On the other side  
I know you're waiting for me  
On the other side
