# You Only Live Once

Some people think they're always right
Others are quiet and uptight
Others they seem so very nice nice nice nice nice oh oh
Inside they might feel sad and wrong oh no

Twenty-nine different attributes
Only seven that you like oh oh
Twenty ways to see the world oh oh
Are twenty ways to start a fight oh oh 

Oh don't don't don't get up
Cause I can't see the sunshine
I'll be waiting for you baby 
Cause I'm through

Sit me down
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you

Oh men don't notice what they got
Oh women think of that a lot
One thousand ways to please your man oh oh
Not even one requires a plan I know

And countless odd religions too
It doesn't matter which you choose oh no
One stubborn way to turn your back oh oh
This I've tried and now refuse oh oh

Oh don't don't don't get up
Cause I can't see the sunshine oh oh
I'll be waiting for you baby 
Cause I'm through

Sit me down
Shut me up
I'll calm down
And I'll get along with you

Alright
Shut me up
Shut me up
And I'll get along with you
