# Evening Sun

They love you or they hate you
But they will never let you be
They'll thrill you or sedate you
But they will never let you see

Sun

Encourage and derange you
Watch you walking scared alone
Despite intimidation
Pleased to watch you dance alone

In the

In the

Sun

Go your separate way now
Someday you'll come back
And I'll be dreaming I was sunburned
I don't wanna break your heart in

Break your heart in two halves
Keep one half and give one half to me
I like the summer miss the summer
Tell me what'd you do nothing me too

All actors are pretending
And singers they will sometimes lie
All kids are always honest
Cause they don't think
They're ever gonna die

Oh you are the prettiest
Smartest captain of the team
I love you more than
Being seventeen
