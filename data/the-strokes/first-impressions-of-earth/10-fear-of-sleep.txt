# Fear of Sleep

How did anybody find out where I was
How did anybody find that out
I was hiding from the world I was a squirrel
But you chopped down my tree to get my fur

Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep

Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Oh fear of sleep
Can't you wait

I'm not done
Fear of sleep
Here you come

Fall asleep
Fall asleep
Fall asleep

You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun

You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun

I guess everybody's week must have been pretty rough
Cause everybody is drunk loud and pissed off
I know you hate to be impressed with someone else
Other than yourself
But you know trying to hold back on being an asshole helps

Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep
Fear of sleep

Where'd you go
Fear of sleep
Oh fear of sleep
So you know

I'm not done
Here we go
Here you come

Fall asleep
Fall asleep
Fall asleep

You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun

You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun

You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun

You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun
You're no fun

You're no fun
You're no fun
