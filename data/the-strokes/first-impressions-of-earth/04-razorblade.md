# Razorblade

Oh the razorblade
That's what I call love
I bet you'd pick it up and mess around with it
If I put it down

It gets extremely complicated
Anything to forget everything

You've got to take me out
At least once a week
Whether I'm in your arms
Or I'm at your feet 

I know exactly what you're thinking
You wan't say it now
But in your heart it's loud

Oh no
My feelings are more important than yours

Oh
Drop dead I don't care I won't worry

There you go

Oh the razorblade
Wish it would snap this rope
The world is in your hands
Or it's at your throat

At times it's not that complicated
Anything to forget everything

He would never talk
But he was not shy
She was a street girl
But she could not lie

They were perfect for each other
Say it now
Cause in your heart i'ts loud

Oh no
My feelings are more important than yours

Oh
Drop dead I don't care I won't worry

Hey

Sweetheart
Your feelings are more important of course
Of course

Everyone that wanted everything
That we would take from them
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Tell me tell me tell me
No don't okay
