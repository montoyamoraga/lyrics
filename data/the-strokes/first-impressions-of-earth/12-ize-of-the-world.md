# Ize of the World  

I think I know what you mean  
But watch what you say  
Cause they'll be trying to knock  
You down in some way  

Sometimes it feels like the world  
Is falling asleep  
How do you wake someone up  
From inside a dream  

Your mind would wander and search  
For its place in the night  
Your body followed this feeling  
Like following light  

Once that your music was born  
It followed you around  
And then it gave your activities  
Meaning and let you be loud  

You're sad but you smile  
It's not in your eyes  
Your eyeballs don't change  
It's the muscles around your eyes  

An egg to fertilize  
A pulse to stabilize  
A body to deodorize  
A life to scrutinize  

A child to criticize  
Young adults to modernize  
Citizens to terrorize  
Generations to desensitize  

Your dreams are sweet and obsessed  
And you're overworked  
You're overtaken by visions  
Of being overlooked  

How disappointed would D.I.
D.I.P.P. be  
To see such a power in our hands  
All wasted on greed  

Am I a prisoner to instincts  
Or do my thoughts just live  
As free and detached  
As boats to the dock  

Just like the music was born  
And detached from your heart  
Is your free time to free minds  
Or for falling apart  

Night after night  
You turn off the light  
You don't fall asleep right away  
Are we are we done  

A desk to organize  
A product to advertise  
A market to monopolize  
Movie stars to idolize  

Leaders to scandalize  
Enemies to neutralize  
No time to apologize  
Fury to tranquilize  

Weapons to synchronize  
Cities to vapori
