# Take It Or Leave It

Leave me alone
I'm in control
I'm in control

And girls act too much
And boys act too tough
Enough is enough

We're on the minds
Of the other men
I know she was

I said
Just take it
Or leave it

And take it
Or leave it

And take it
Or leave it

And take it
Or leave it

Oh just take it
Or leave it

And take it
Or leave it
Oh take it

Oh that's right

He's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down

And gonna break your back
For a chance

And gonna steal your friends
If he can

He's gonna win someday

I fell of the track
Now I can't go back
I'm not like that

Boys act too much
Girls act too tough
Enough is enough

We're on the minds
Of other girls
I know he was

I said
Just take it
Or leave it

And take it
Or leave it

And take it
Or leave it

And take it
Or leave it

Oh just take it
Or leave it

And take it
Or leave it
Oh take it

Oh that's right

He's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down
He's gonna let you down

And gonna break your back
For a chance
And gonna steal your friends
If he can

He's gonna win someday
Oh he will
