# Soma  

Soma is what
They would take when  
Hard times
Opened their eyes
Saw pain in a new way  

High stakes
For a few names
Racing against sunbeams  
Losing against their dreams  
In your eyes  

And I am
Stop  
And go  
In your eyes  

See I am
Stop  
And go  
In your eyes  

Let's go  

When I saw her  
For the first time  
Lips moved  
As her eyes closed  
Heard something in his voice  

And I'll be there  
He says  
Then he walks out  
Somehow he was trying  
Too hard to be like them  

And I am
Stop  
And go  
In your eyes  

And I am
Stop  
Oh darling let me go  

Tried it once and they liked it  
And tried to hide it  
Says I've been doing this  
Twenty-five years  
Well I'm not listening no more  

And these friends  
They keep asking  
For more  
Oh yeah  

Oh but that's it
