# Someday

In many ways
They'll miss the good old days
Someday
Someday

Yeah it hurts to say
But I want you to stay
Sometimes
Sometimes

When we was young
Oh man did we have fun
Always
Always

Promises
They break before they're made
Sometimes
Sometimes

Oh Maya says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you wanna stand by my side
Darling your head's not right

See alone we stand together we fall apart
Yeah I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables they turn sometimes

Oh someday
No I ain't wasting no more time

Trying
Trying

And now my fears
They come to me in threes
So I
Sometimes

Say fate my friend
You say the strangest things
I find
Sometimes

Oh Maya says I'm lacking in depth
Shit I will try my best
You say you wanna stand by my side
Darling your head's not right

See alone we stand together we fall apart
Yeah I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables they turn sometimes

Oh someday
I ain't wasting no more time
