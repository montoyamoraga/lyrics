# When It Started

Won't decide
But he won't debate
Said thanks my friend
Thought it was too late
Oh why oh why
I don't know

So you think things move
Pretty fast down here
Well just wait my dear
Til you look up there
Oh maybe some
Day you'll know

Had his second kid
Was an early night
Got to be well dressed
Cause he hates to fly
Oh loves his job
Takes it home

Anything they wanted
They could
Have it
Have it

Didn't even notice
I don't
Mind it
Mind it

Won't decide
But he won't debate
Said thanks my friend
Thought that we was dead
Oh why oh why
I don't know

Think things move
Pretty fast down here
Well just wait my dear
Til we get up there
Oh maybe some
Day they'll know

Come on tell me
Does she
Warm the
Room when
He comes

Or does he just
Know how
To leave
When it
Gets cold

I don't care
I don't care
Cause it's free
