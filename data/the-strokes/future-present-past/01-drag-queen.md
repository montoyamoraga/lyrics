# Drag Queen  

Eighties peoples dancing oh
Always get it right  
I'd listen it but I can't tonight  
I can't tonight I can't tonight  

Well it's something that you do  
To get it right  
End up reviled for it  
Yeah that's the thanks I get  

I don't understand  
Your fucked up system  
This sinister city  
Try to sell the water  
Try to sell the air  
Try to sell your daughter  
Try to sell her hair  

Verse  

We all want to watch the fight  
Is it on Sunday  
Hide in a hole with a gun in your hand  
In front of  
Someone you want dead I guess  
Hiding in your suit  

I did not know that  
They're bringing me back to my past  
I got my head in my hands  
I got my head in my  
I got my head in my hands  
I got my head in my  
I got my head  

It's just something that you do  
To get it right  
End up reviled for it  
Yeah that's the thanks I get  

Jail that's what you get  
Stepping to the system  
Profiting from war  
Fighting as the victim  
Always wanting more  
Trying to trick your brothers  
Get them to fight it for you  

I cannot believe my eyes  
Darling I can tell you lies  
Coast to coast  
L.A. to Chicago  
I don't know geography all that well  

Defying western logic  
Even if it shows you're wrong  
I guess that's a classic  
Been with us all along
