# You're So Right

Tell me what happened
Tell me what happened
Tell me what happened
If you like

Get off on the same floor
Get off on the same floor
Get off on the same floor
Every night

What are the reasons
What are the reasons
What are the reasons
To find more

I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you
Nothing more

In my mind
Gave a hand
Never once
Gave a damn

I'm done with the office
I'm done with the office
I'm done with the office
Hello forest

I still want to ask you
I still want to ask you
I still want to ask you
Something more

In my mind
Gave a hand
Never once
Gave a damn

I
Don't want to fight
Don't want to beg
You any

I
Don't want to fight
Don't want to beg
You any

I
Don't want to fight
Don't want to beg
You anymore

I don't wanna argue
I don't wanna argue
I don't wanna argue
You think you won

I wouldn't hurt you
I wouldn't hurt you
Well maybe I'd hurt you
If I could
