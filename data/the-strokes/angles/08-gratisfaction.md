Oh baby don't you be so mad
Because I barely remember
And she tries to recognize me with the eyes
She saw me with in December

And she's starting to realize that it's actually
Not a good thing
And it's so tough because you're down to go out again
And have another adventure

All her friends in the alleyway shout back
But she can't hear them

But you're never gonna get my love
We can only play in the sun
Get up in the morning and run
You'll be frustrated til the day that you're done

He got punched in the mouth for sticking his nose
In other's people's business
No good solution always on the verge
Of some revolution

Well tough luck it may take a thousand years
But I think we can do it
Best friends fight but they never enjoy life
As good as when they abuse it

He said the soldier is a necessity
Lied of all the failures of man yeah

But you're never gonna get my love
We can only fight in the sand
You get tired when the days are too long
You get lonely when the days are gone

He could never mention it out here and now
Without quick tears in his eyes

But you're never gonna get my love
We can only fight in the sand
You get tired when the days are too long
You get lonely when the days are gone

Oh you're never gonna get this love
We can roll around in the dark
That's about as far as we go
Get up in the morning and run
