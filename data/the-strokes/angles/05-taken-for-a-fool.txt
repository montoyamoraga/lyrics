# Taken for a Fool

Sister
It feels like just yesterday

Sister
Don't you forget my number
On the door

You've got something and it's so good to see
Something wonderful that I could not be

Everybody hanging on for their lives
But you can't help them cause you don't have the time

I know everyone goes any damn place they like
I hope this goes over well on the toxic radio yeah

You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why

You're so gullible but I don't mind
Oh that's no the problem

And I don't need anyone with me right now
Monday Tuesday is my weekend

You get taken for a fool all the time
I don't know why

Blame yourself for once quit putting it on me
I can't help you cause I've seen what it means

It's so early I don't want to wake up
Oh we are so lucky cause we never grow up

Mama mama
It feels like just yesterday

Mama mama
Don't you forget my number
I don't want to be the one at the door

I know everyone goes any damn place they choose
And I hope everyone well on the toxic radio

A tourist in the ghetto not afraid of anything
Except death and anything else that could maybe hurt them oh yeah

You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why

You're so gullible but I don't mind
Oh that's not the problem

And I don't need anyone with me right now
Monday Tuesday is my weekend

You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why

You get taken all the time for a fool
I don't know why
I don't know why
