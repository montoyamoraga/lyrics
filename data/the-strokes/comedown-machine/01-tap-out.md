# Tap Out  

They found our city under the water  
Gotta get my hands on something new  
You don't want to be without this  
Something isn't adding up  

Decide my past  
Define my life  
Don't ask questions  
Cause I don't know why  

Someone  
Didn't wanna know their name  
Drifting  
You don't wanna know what's going down  

Even  
Though I really like your place  
Somehow  
We don't have to know each other's name  

They found our city under the water  
I began to listen to your eyes  
You don't want to live without it  
Leaving others in a bind  

Decide my past  
Define my life  
Don't ask questions  
Cause I don't know why  

Someone  
Didn't wanna know their name  
Drifting  
You don't wanna know what's going down  

Even  
Though I really like your place  
Somehow  
We don't have to know each other's name  

Someone  
Didn't wanna know their name  
Drifting  
You don't wanna know what's going down  

Even  
Though I really like your place  
Somehow  
We don't have to know each other's name  

Decide my past  
Define my life  
Don't ask questions  
Cause I don't know why  

I don't listen  
And I don't speak  
Well it's a talent  
But I don't know why
