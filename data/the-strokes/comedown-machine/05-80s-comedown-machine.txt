# 80's Comedown Machine

It's not the first time
That I've watched you
Passing by

I've tried too hard
To get back there
But you're not on time
Anymore

I tried to believe in you
For a second try
You said the world's closed in
But you crawled in
Back inside

So please
Run away

So please
Run away

I tried to believe in fate
For a second try
It's there in the safe
Why don't you
Close the blinds

For the night

So please
Run away

So please
Run away

So please
Run away

So please
Run away

So please
Run away

Run away
