# All The Time  

Those that try  
Anything once  
Should we care  
About the only ones  

All the time
That I need  
Is never quite enough  

All the time
That I have  
Is all that's necessary  

You're living a lie  
You're living a lie  
You're living too fast  
You gotta pray for the best  

You never ask why  
You never ask why  
You're living a lie  
Baby you're flying too high  

No one talks  
About the war  
On my block  
Or by the shore  

All alone in a room  
Do you know what I want too  
All the time in the world  
Is all that's necessary  

You're living a lie  
You're living a lie  
You're living too fast  
You gotta pray for the best  

You never ask why  
You never ask why  
You're living a lie  
Baby you're flying too high  

You never ask why  
You never ask why  
You're living a lie  
Baby you're flying too high  

Don't get on the phone  
Don't reach for the door  
You know the answer  
That you're looking for  

You're living a lie  
You're living a lie  
You're living too fast  
You gotta pray for the best  

You never ask why  
You never ask why  
You're living a lie  
Baby you're flying too high
