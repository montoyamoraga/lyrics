# Call It Fate, Call It Karma

Close the door
Not all the way
He don't understand
We don't understand

So don't you wanna remind me
I don't know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place

Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk
Can I stand in your light just for a while
I've waited around to wait in a room
I made up more time watching you

You got it down now don't you
I wanted to understand your face

So don't you wanna remind me
I don't know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place

Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk
Can I stand in your light just for a while
I've waited around to wait in a room
I made up more time watching you

I needed someone
I needed someone
