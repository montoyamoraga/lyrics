# The Modern Age

Up on a hill here's where we begin
This little story a long time ago
Start to pretend stop pretending
It seems this game is simply never ending

In the sun sun having fun it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now let me go
Oh let me
go go go go go go go go

Leaving just in time
Stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean
Trying to catch her eye

Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different
So I'll pretend I'll pretend I'm leaving

I feel so different now we trained at AVA
I wish you hadn't stayed
My vision's clearer now but I'm unafraid

Flying overseas
No time to feel the breeze
I took too many varieties

Well in the sun sun having fun it's in my blood
I just can't help it
Don't want you here right now let me go
Oh let me
go go go go go go go go

Leaving just in time
Stay there for a while
Rolling in the ocean
Trying to catch her eye

Work hard and say it's easy
Do it just to please me
Tomorrow will be different
This is why I'm leaving
