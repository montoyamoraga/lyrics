# I Can't Win

That was you up on the mountain
All alone and all surrounded
Walking on the ground you're breaking
Laughing at the life you're wasting

One two tries won't do it
You do it all and you never get through it
Everything they had to say
Had been erased in just one day

Good try
We don't like it
Good try
We won't take that shit
Oh I can't win

Things in bars that people do
When no one wants to talk to you
Failing can be quite a breeze
He told me that these girls were easy

Felt unlucky when you found me
Some nights come up empty handed
Yes I'll take it

Wait now
By the sidewalk
Hold on
Yes I'll be right back
Oh I can't win

Yeah I
Wait for something
Cool it
We won't take that shit
Good try
We don't like it
Hold on 
Yes I'll be right back
