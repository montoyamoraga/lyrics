# Automatic Stop  

So many fish  
There in the sea  
I wanted you  
You wanted me  

That's just a phase  
It's got to pass  
I was a train  
Moving too fast  

Didn't understand  
What to see  
Yeah then I got a different view  
It's you  

No  

Wait  
I'm not gonna give it a break  
I'm not your friend  
I never was  

I said wait  
I'm not gonna give it a break  
I'm not your friend  
I never was  

No  

So many fish  
There in the sea  
She wanted him  
He wanted me  

That's just a phase  
It's got to pass  
I was a train  
Moving too fast  

Yeah I know
You warned me
But this is too important  
And now I got a different view  
It's you  

Why can't you wait  
I'm not gonna give it a break  
I'm not your friend  
I never was  

I said wait  
I'm not gonna give it a break  
I'm not your friend  
I never was
