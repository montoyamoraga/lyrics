# Meet Me In The Bathroom

When they say promises
They mean promises

They'd say that's okay
Long as we can celebrate

Ooh you see
My uncle would say
Things would change
When he's dead

Meet me in the bathroom
That's what she said
I don't mind
It's true

Hey

Never was on time
Yes I once was mine

Well that was long ago
And darling I don't mind

Yeah we were just two friends in lust
And baby that just don't mean much

Oh yeah you trained me not to love
After you showed me what it was

Now she's staring wide eyed
Can't close her eyes

Say what

Anywhere is fine
Just don't waste my time

Ah you see
My uncle would say
Things would change
Once he's dead

Meet me in the bathroom
That's what she said
I don't mind
It's true

Never was on time
Yes I once was mine

Well that was long ago
And darling I don't mind

Yeah they were just two fucks in lust
And baby that just don't mean much

Oh yeah you trained me not to love
After you taught me what it was
