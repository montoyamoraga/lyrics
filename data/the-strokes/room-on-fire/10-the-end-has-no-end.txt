# The End Has No End

One by one
Ticking time bombs won
It's not the secrets of the government
That's keeping you dumb
Oh it's the other way around
Wait what's that sound
One by one
Baby here they come

He wants it easy
He wants it relaxed
Said I can't do a lot of things
But I can't do that
Two steps forward
Then three steps back
Alright

Won't you take a walk outside
Oh no
Can't you find some other guy
Oh no

One nine six nine what's that sound
Oh no
Keeping down the underground
Oh no

The end has no end
The end has no end
The end has no end
The end has no end

He wants it easy
He wants it relaxed
Said I can do a lot of things
But I can't do that 
Two three steps forward
Then three steps back
It won't be easy

Won't you take a walk outside
Oh no
Can't you find some other guy
Oh no

One nine six three what's that sound
Oh no
Keeping down the underground
Oh no

The end has no end
The end has no end
The end has no end
The end has no end

The end has no end
The end has no end
The end has no end
The end has no end
