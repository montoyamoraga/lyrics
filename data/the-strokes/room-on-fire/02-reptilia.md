# Reptilia  

He seemed impressed  
By the way you came in  
Tell us a story  
I know you're not boring  

I was afraid  
That you would not insist  
You sound so sleepy  
Just take this  
Now leave me  

I said  
Please don't slow me down  
If I'm going too fast  
You're in a strange  
Part of our town  

Yeah the night's not over  
You're not trying hard enough  
Our live are changing lanes  
You ran me off the road  

The wait is over  
I'm now taking over  
You're no longer laughing  
I'm not drowning fast enough  

Now every time  
That I look at myself  
I thought I told you  
This world is not for you  

The room is on fire  
As she's fixing her hair  
You sound so angry  
Just calm down  
You found me  

I said  
Please don't slow me down  
If I'm going too fast  
You're in a strange  
Part of our town  

Yeah the night's not over  
You're not trying hard enough  
Our live are changing lanes  
You ran me off the road  

The wait is over  
I'm now taking over  
You're no longer laughing  
I'm not drowning fast enough
