# Your Lips Are Red

Your lips are red
My face is red from reading your red lips
My hands are black
My hands are black inside this downtown taxi cab
This city's red
This city's red from riding us into the ground
This city's black
This city's black from all the ashes in downtown
Ashes in downtown
Ashes in downtown

My face is drawn
My face is drawn on with this number two pencil
Your face is drawn
Your face is drawn from drawing words right from my lips
Words right from my lips
Words right from my lips

Your lips are red
My face is red from reading your red lips
My hands are red
My hands are red from sealing your red lips
Sealing your red lips
Sealing your red lips

Your skin's so fair
Your skin's so fair it's not fair
Your skin's so fair
Your skin's so fair it's not fair
Your skin's so fair
Your skin's so fair it's not fair
You remind me
Your skin's so fair
Your skin's so fair it's not fair
You remind me
Your skin's so fair
Your skin's so fair it's not fair
You remind me
Your skin's so fair
Your skin's so fair it's not fair
You remind me
