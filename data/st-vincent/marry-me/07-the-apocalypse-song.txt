# The Apocalypse Song

Wait I'll be swifter
Than the speed of light
Carbon all my body
A billion years of time

You'll wake with the stitches
Over both your eyes
And deny me my body
And all earthly delights

It's time you are light
I guess you are afraid
Of what everyone is made of

Time and light
I guess you are afraid
Of what everyone is made of

All of your praying
Amounts to just one breath
Please keep your victory
But give me a little death

It's time you are light
I guess you are afraid
Of what everyone is made of

Time and light
I guess you are afraid
Of what everyone is made of

Time
Time
Time
Time

Time you are light
I guess you are afraid
Of what everyone is made of

Time and light
I guess you are afraid
Of what everyone is made of

So take to the streets with
Apocalypse refrain
Your devotion has the look of
A lunatic's gaze
