# Jesus Saves, I Spend

While Jesus is saving
I'm spending all my days
In backgrounds and landscapes
With the languages of saints

While people are spinning
Like toys on Christmas day
I'm inside a still life
Wit the other absentee

While Jesus is saving
I'm spending all my days
In the garden grey pallor
Of lines across your face

While people will cheer on
The spectacle we've made
I'm sitting and sculpting
Menageries of saints

Oh my man my absentee
I'd do anything to please you
Come my love the stage is waiting
Be the one to save my saving grace

While Jesus is saving
I'm spending all my grace
On the rosy red pallor
Of lights on center stage

While people have cheered on
The awful mess we've made
Through storms of red roses
We've exited the stage
