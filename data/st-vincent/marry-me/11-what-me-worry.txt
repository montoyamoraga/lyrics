# What Me Worry

What me worry
I never do
I'm always amused
And amusing you

Sans le fear of
Impending doom
Life is like banquet food
Pleasure to peruse

Do I amuse you dear
Would you think me queer if
While standing beside you
I opted instead to disappear
Disappear

In no hurry
I'll sing my tune
All my skies the hue
Of a ruddy bruise

In my finest threads couture
I'll cap up my favorite muse for a drink
Half full or two

Have I abused you dear
You have had it to here
You say love is just a blood match
To see who endures lash
After lash
With panache

In the spring
I'll dust off my lute
Stuff my suitcase
Full of blues

And I'll stir the dust underneath
The thrust of my clicking heels
C'est la vie

What me worry
I never do
Life is one charming ruse
For us lucky few

Have I fooled you dear
The time it's coming near
When I'll give you my hand
And I'll say it's been grand but
I'm out of here
I'm out of here
