# Human Racing

Romeo where'd you go
It's been years and still no sign
But I'm keeping hope alive

Juliet how you been
You look like death
Like you sure could use some rest
From this place
Human racing
And the faces of people who pound at your door
They'll always want more
They'll want more

Hummingbird what's the word
Are you still your mother's child
Or have you found yourself a flower

Flower child
You're still wild
Under a harvest moon
Can we eat of all the fruits
Of our youth
Tell the truth now
Your heart is a strange little orange to peel
What's the deal
What's the deal

Mary dear
How you feel
Are you lost without your lamb
You know I think I understand

Little lamb what's your plan
Greener pastures in the sky
It's a shame you want to die know why
Just to find
You've been blinded
To the greenest of pastures
They're right here on earth
For what is worth

You're not the first to break my heart
You're not the first to break my heart
You're not the first to break my heart
You're not the first to break my heart
