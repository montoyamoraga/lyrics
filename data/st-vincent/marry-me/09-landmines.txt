# Landmines

I'm crawling through landmines
Just to know where you are
There's smoke in my eyes
Cause you're burning the ground

I'm crawling through landmines
Just to feel where you are
Under cover of night
I put a pearl in the ground

Where'd you go
Not so far
Please don't go
Not too far

Where'd you go
Not so far
Please don't go
Not too far

I found your ring
With the feather on
One arm in
And one arm gone
Save this ring
Let's bring Paris
Right here

Oh my dear
My love
Do you know my love
Do you know

I'm crawling through landmines
Just to feel where you've been
There's gauze over my eyes
But you're leaving this trail

I'm crawling through landmines
I know cause I planted them
Under cover of night
I put my heart in the ground

Oh where'd you go
Not so far
Please don't go
Not too far

Where'd you go
Not so far
Please don't go
Not too far

I found your glove
With the leather torn
Five fingers that
I'm counting on
Smoke signals
To call you right here

Oh my love
My dear
My love
My dear
