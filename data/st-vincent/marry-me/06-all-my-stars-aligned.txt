# All My Stars Aligned

I read the signs
I got all my stars aligned
My amulets my charms
I set all my false alarms

So I'll be someone
Who won't be forgotten
I've got a question
And you've got the answer

I do a dance to make the rain come
Smile to keep the sky from falling down down down down
Collect the love that I've been given
Build a nest for us to sleep in here
You know it's real

I check my palms
The cracks in the sidewalk
My visions and my dreams
I cross all my fingers

That you'll be someone
Who won't be forgotten
What was your question
I've got the answer

I do a dance to make the rain come
Smile to keep the sky from falling down down down down
Collect the love that I've been given
Build a nest for us to sleep in here
You know it's real

There are no signs
There are no stars aligned
No amulets not a charm
To bring you back to my arms
There's just this human heart
That's built with this human flaw
What was your question
Love is the answer

I do a dance to make the rain come
Smile to keep the sky from falling down down down down
Collect the love that I've been given
Build a nest for us to sleep in here
You know it's real
