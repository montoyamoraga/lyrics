# Now, Now

I'm not your mother's favorite dog
I'm not the carpet you walk on
I'm not one small atomic bomb

I'm not any any any any any any
Anything at all

I'm not the feather at your feet
I'm not your yellow brick street
I'm not anyone you'll see

I'm not any any any any any any any
Anything

Now now
Now now
Now now

You don't mean that say you're sorry
You don't mean that say you're sorry
You don't mean that say you're sorry
You don't mean that
I'll make you sorry

I'm not the pawn to your king
I'm not your world on a string
I'm not anyone you'll beat

I'm not any any any any any any any
Anything
Any any any any any any any
Anything

Now now
Now now
Now now

You don't mean that say you're sorry
You don't mean that say you're sorry
You don't mean that say you're sorry
You don't mean that
I'll make you sorry

You don't mean that say you're sorry
You don't mean that say you're sorry
You don't mean that say you're sorry
You don't mean that say you're sorry
You don't mean that say you're sorry
