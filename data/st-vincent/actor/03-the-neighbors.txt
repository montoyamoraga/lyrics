# The Neighbors

Sister say a prayer for us
One we learned from nuns and such
I won't believe not a word you speak
Just make it sweet to hear

Let's pour wine in coffee cups
And drive around the neighborhood
And shine the headlights on houses
Until all the news is good

Oh no
What would your mother say
Oh no
What would your father do
Oh no
What would the neighbors think
Oh no

How I am supposed to sleep
Roaming blackouts on the street
Oh not a word not another speech
We'll run the headlights down

These kids are foaming at the mouth
Psychotropic capricorns
Tomorrow's some kind of strangerland
Where all the news is good

Oh no
What would your mother say
Oh no
What would your father do
Oh no
What would the neighbors think
Oh no
If they only knew
Knew

How can Monday be alright
Then on Tuesday lose my mind
Tomorrow's some kind of stranger
Who I'm not supposed to see

Oh no
What would your mother say
Oh no
What would your father do
Oh no
What would the neighbors think
Oh no
If they only knew
Knew
