# The Party

Honey the party you went away quickly
But oh that's the trouble with ticking and talking
I lick the ice cube from your empty glass
Oh we've stayed much too late
Till they're cleaning the ashtrays

Do you have change or a button or cash
Oh my pockets hang out like two surrender flags
Oh but I'd pay anything to keep my conscience clean
I'm keeping my eye on the exit sign steady now

How did we get here
With creaks in these chairs
Oh there aren't enough hands to point all the fingers
But I sit transfixed by a hole in your tee shirt
Oh I've said much too much and they're trying to sweep up
