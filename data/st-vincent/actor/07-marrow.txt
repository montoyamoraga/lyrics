# Marrow

Muscle connects to the bone
And bone to the ire and the marrow
I wish I had a gentle mind
And a spine made up of iron

Mouth connects to the teeth
And teeth to the loves and the curses
Honey can you reach the spots
That need oiling and fixing

H E L P
Help me
Help me

H E L P
Help me
Help me

Muscle connects to the bone
And bone to the ire and the marrow
So I pretend there aren't ten strings
Tied to all ten of my fingers

H E L P
Help me
Help me

If you want we could go somewhere else
