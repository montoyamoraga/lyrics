# Save Me From What I Want

Keys are in my pocket and they
Watch your step
Rattle you away
Watch your step
Seventh floor apartment and a
Watch your step
Fiery escape
But
I'm a wife in watercolors
Watch your step
I can wash away
Watch your step
What seventeen cold showers couldn't
Watch your step
Wash away

Save me
Save me
Save me from what I want

Save me
Save me
Save me from what I want

Honey what reveals you is what you
Watch your step
Try and hide away
Watch your step
You could tell the planets or your
Watch your step
Pillow case
But
Watch your step
I'm a wife in watercolors
Watch your step
I can wash away
Watch your step
What seventeen cold showers couldn't
Watch your step
Wash away

Save me
Save me
Save me from what I want

Save me
Save me
Save me from what I want

Save me
Save me
Save me from what I want

Save me
Save me
Save me from what I want

Save me
Save me
Save me from what I want

Save me
Save me
Save me from what I want
