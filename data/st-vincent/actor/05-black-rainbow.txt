# Black Rainbow

There's a black rainbow above my house
Match the curtains and the floors
Think I'm glass I think I'm breaking it
Wrecking ball outside the door

Let the children act like furniture
For the ladies of the lawn
But I can't see them I can't see at all
Here it's night time all the time

Bird outside the kitchen
Fighting his reflection
Tell him I got nothing for him

Bird outside the kitchen
Fighting his reflection
What's he going to win when he wins

Unkissed boys and girls of paradise
Lining up around the block
Back pockets full of dynamite
While the neighbors talk and talk and talk

Bird outside the kitchen
Fighting his reflection
Tell him I got nothing for him

Bird outside the kitchen
Fighting his reflection
What's he going to win when he wins

Throw the phone out the window
If you want the neighbors woke
You'll have to shout out loud

And set the bed alight and slow
If you want the neighbors woke
You'll have to shout even louder
