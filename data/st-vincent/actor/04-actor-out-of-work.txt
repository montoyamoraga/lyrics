# Actor Out Of Work

You're a supplement
You're a salve
You are a bandage
Pull it off
I can quit you
Cut it out
You're a patient
Iron lung

You're a cast signed
Broken arm
You're an actor
Out of work
You're a liar
And that's the truth
You're an extra
Lost in the scene

You're a boxer
In the ring
With brass knuckles
Underneath
You're the curses
Through my teeth
You're the laughter
You're the obscene

You're a supplement
You're a salve
You are a bandage
Pull it off
I think I love you
I think I'm mad

You're a cast signed
Broken arm
You're an actor
Out of work
I think I love you
I think I'm mad

You're a boxer
In the ring
With brass knuckles
Underneath
I think I love you
I think I'm mad
