# New York

New York isn't New York without you love
So far in a few blocks to be solo

And if I called you from First Avenue
Well you're the only motherfucker in the city who can handle me

New love wasn't true love back to you love
So much for a home run with some blue bloods

If I last strawed you on Eight Avenue
Well you're the only motherfucker in the city who can stand me

I have lost a hero
I have lost a friend
But for you darling
I'd do it all again

I have lost a hero
I have lost a friend
But for you darling
I'd do it all again

New York isn't New York without you love
Too few of our old crew left on Astor

So if I trade our hood for some Hollywood
Well you're the only motherfucker in the city who would
Only motherfucker in the city who would
Only motherfucker in the city who'll forgive me

I have lost a hero
I have lost a friend
But for you darling
I'd do it all again

I have lost a hero
I have lost a friend
But for you darling
I'd do it all again
