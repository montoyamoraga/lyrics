# Masseduction

Black saint sinner lady
Playing knock-off soul
A punk rock romantic
Slumped on the kitchen floor

Nuns in stress positions
Smoking Marlboros
Lolita is weeping
The bride is beautiful

Masseduction
Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on

Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on

Smiling nihilist met
Angry glass half full
Drinking Manic Panic
Singing Boatman's Call

Teenage Christian virgins
Holding out their tongues
Paranoid secretions
Falling on basement rugs

Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on

Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on

Oh what a bore
To be so adored
Oh what a bore
To be so adored

Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Masseduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on

Mass destruction
Mass destruction
Mass destruction
Mass destruction

I don't turn off what turns me on

Mass destruction
Mass destruction
Mass destruction
Mass destruction
