# Hang On Me

I know you're probably sleeping
I got this thing I keep thinking
Yeah I admit I been drinking
The void is back and unblinking

I cannot stop the airplane from crashing
And we circle down from the sky

Yeah so hang on me
Hang on me
Hang on me

Cause you and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this world

I know you hate my hysterics
I promise this time is different
I won't cry wolf in the kitchen
Just please oh please don't hang up yet

I cannot stop the taxi cab from crashing
And only lovers will survive

Yeah so hang on me
Hang on me
Hang on me

Cause you and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this world

You and me
We're not meant for this world
You and me
We're not meant for this world
