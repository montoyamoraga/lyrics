Sugarboy
I'm in need
How I wish
For something sweet

Sugarboy
I am weak
Got a crush
On tragedy

Oh here I go
A casualty
Hanging on
From the balcony

Oh here I go
Making a scene
Oh here I am
Your pain machine

I am a lot like you
Boys
I am alone like you
Girls
I am a lot like you
Boys
I am alone like you

I am a lot like you
Boys
I am alone like you
Girls
I am a lot like you
Boys
I am alone like you

Sugargirl
Figurine
Pledge all your
Allegiance to me

Sugargirl
Dissolve in me
Got a crush
From kicked-in teeth

Oh here I go
A casualty
Hanging on
From the balcony

Oh here I go
Making a scene
Oh here I am
Your pain machine

I am a lot like you
Boys
I am alone like you
Girls
I am a lot like you
Boys
I am alone like you

I am a lot like you
Boys
I am alone like you
Girls
I am a lot like you
Boys
I am alone like you
