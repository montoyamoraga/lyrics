# Savior

You dress me up in a nurse's outfit
It rides and sticks to my thighs and my hips
You put me in a teacher's little denim skirt
Ruler and desk so I can make it hurt

But I keep you on your best behavior
Honey I can't be your savior
Love you to the grave and farther
Honey I am not your martyr

You dress me in a nun's black habit
Hail Mary pass cause you know I'll grab it
Hand me a badge and a little billy club
Like I'm supposed to book you on a hit-and-run

Adore you to the grave and farther
Honey I can't be your martyr
Maybe it's just human nature
But honey I can't be your savior

But then you say
Please
Then you say
Please

Dress me in leather oh that's a litle better
But that's still not it none of this shit fits

But I keep you on your best behavior
Honey I can't be your savior
Love you to the grave and farther
Honey I am not your martyr

But then you say
Please
Then you say
Please

Please
Please

Please
They call me a strange girl
And they speak to me in bruises

Please
I got them trying to save the world
They said girl you're not Jesus
They call me a strange girl

Please
And they speak to me in bruises
I got them trying to save the world
They said girl you're not Jesus

Please
They call me a strange girl
And they speak to me in bruises

Please
I got them trying to save the world
They said girl you're not Jesus

Please
I got them trying to save the world

Please
They call me a strange girl
And they speak to me in bruises

Please
I got them trying to save the world
They said girl you're not Jesus
