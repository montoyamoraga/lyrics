Pills to wake
Pills to sleep
Pills pills pills
Every day of the week

Pills to work
Pills to think
Pills pills pills
For the family

I spent a year suspended in air
My mind on the gap my head on the stairs
From healers to dealers and then back again
From guru to voodoo and voodoo to zen

Pills to wake
Pills to sleep
Pills pills pills
Every day of the week

Pills to work
Pills to think
Pills pills pills
For the family

Pills to grow
Pills to shrink
Pills pills pills
And a good stiff drink

Pills to fuck
Pills to eat
Pills pills pills
Down the kitchen sink

I'm behind the wheel I'm leaving your state
I can't even swim in these waves I made
From the bath to the drain and the plane to the stage
To the bead to give head to the money I made

Pills to wake
Pills to sleep
Pills pills pills
Every day of the week

Pills to work
Pills to think
Pills pills pills
For the family

Pills to grow
Pills to shrink
Pills pills pills
And a good stiff drink

Pills to fuck
Pills to eat
Pills pills pills
Down the kitchen sink

I heard the tales fortune and blame
Tigers and wolves defanged by fame
From the chains to the reigns to the vein to the brain
Anyway there's a day and I'll pay it in pain

Pills to wake
Pills to sleep
Pills pills pills
Every day of the week

Pills to work
Pills to think
Pills pills pills
For the family

Pills to grow
Pills to shrink
Pills pills pills
And a good stiff drink

Pills to fuck
Pills to eat
Pills pills pills
Down the kitchen sink

Pills to wake
Pills to sleep
Pills pills pills
Every day of the week

Pills to work
Pills to think
Pills pills pills
For the family

Pills to grow
Pills to shrink
Pills pills pills
And a good stiff drink

Pills to fuck
Pills to eat
Pills pills pills
Down the kitchen sink

Pills to wake
Pills to sleep
Pills pills pills
Every day of the week

Pills to work

Pills pills pills
For the family

Pills to grow

Pills pills pills
And a good stiff drink

Pills pills pills
Down the kitchen sink

Come all you villains
Come one and all
Come all you killers
Come join the wall

Come all you wasted
Wretched and scorned
Come on and face it
Come join the wall

Come climb the rafters
Come out to space
Come for the answers
Throw them away

Come kiss me stupid
Come kiss me sore
Come find me standing
Under the wall

Come all you killers
Come out to play
Everyone you know
Will all go away

Come all you wasted
Wretched and scorned
come watch me standing
Under the wall

Come all you children
Come out to play
Everyone you love
Will all go away
