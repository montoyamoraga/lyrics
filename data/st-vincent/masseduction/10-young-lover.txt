# Young Lover

How long
Has this been going on
I found you in the bathtub
With your clothing on

Oh so what
Your mother did a number
So I get gloves of rubber
To clean up the spill yeah

No I young lover I'm begging you please to wake up
Young lover I wish that I was your drug
No I young lover I miss the taste of your tongue
No I young lover I wish love was enough enough

You say
You got no room to talk babe
You're boozing on a midday
And I don't see no cake

Oh but these pills
I can't even pronounce them
Your thousand watts of light dim
Then you're gone again yeah

No I young lover I'm begging you please to wake up
Young lover I wish that I was your drug
No I young lover I miss the taste of your tongue
No I young lover I wish love was enough enough enough

We were in Paris the Eiffel was shining
All that I wanted was lying on tiling
I heard the robins and thought they were sirens
Wake up young lover I thought you were dying

No I young lover
No I young lover
No I

No I young lover
No I young lover
No I young lover
No I young lover

No I young lover
No I young lover
No I young lover
No I young lover

No I young lover
