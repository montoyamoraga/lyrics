# Los Ageless

In Los Ageless the winter never comes
In Los Ageless the mothers milk their young
But I can keep running
Oh I can keep running

The lost sages hang out by the bar
Burn the pages of unwritten memoirs
But I can keep running
Oh I can keep running

How can anybody have you
How can anybody have you and lose you
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind too

How can anybody have you
How can anybody have you and lose you
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind too

The last days of the sunset superstars
Girls in cages playing their guitars
But how can I leave
I just follow the hood of my car

In Los Ageless the waves they never break
They build and build until you don't have no escape
But how can I leave
I just follow my hood to the sea go to sleep

How can anybody have you
How can anybody have you and lose you
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind too

How can anybody have you
How can anybody have you and lose you
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind too

Oh my Lola we really did it now
I'm a monster and you're my sacred cow
Oh I can keep running
No I can keep running

How can anybody have you
How can anybody have you and lose you
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind too

How can anybody have you
How can anybody have you and lose you
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind too

How can anybody have you
How can anybody have you and lose you
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind too

How can anybody have you
How can anybody have you and lose you
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind too

I guess that's just me honey
I guess that's how I'm built
I try to tell you I love you
And it comes out all sick

I guess that's just me honey
I guess that's how I'm built
I try to write you a love song
But it comes out a lament

I guess that's just me honey
I guess that's how I'm built
I try to tell you I love you
And it comes out all sick

I guess that's just me honey
I guess that's how I'm built
I try to write you a love song
But it comes out a lament

I try to write you a love song
But it comes out a lament
I try to write you a love song
But it comes out a lament
