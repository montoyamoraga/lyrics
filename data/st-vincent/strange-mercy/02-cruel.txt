# Cruel

Bodies
Can't you see what everybody wants from you

Forgive the kids
For they don't know how to live
Run the alleys
Casually

Cruel
Cruel

Bodies
Can't you see what everybody wants from you
If you could want that too

They could take or leave you
Sot they took you and they left you
How could they be
Casually

Cruel
Cruel
Cruel
Cruel

Bodies
Can't you see what everybody wants from you
If you could want that too
Then you'll be happy

You were the one waving flares in the air
So they could see you
And they were the zephyr blowing past you
Blowing fastly so they can't see you

Cruel
Cruel
Cruel
