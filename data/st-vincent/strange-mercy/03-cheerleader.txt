# Cheerleader

I've had good times
With some bad guys
I've told whole lies
With a half smile

Held your bare bones
With my clothes on
I've thrown rocks
Then hid both my arms

I don't know what good it serves
Pouring my purse in the dirt

But I I I I
I don't wanna be your cheerleader no more

I I I I
I don't wanna be your cheerleader no more

I've played dumb
When I knew better
Tried too hard
Just to be clever

I know honest thieves
I call family
I've seen America
With no clothes on

But I I I I
I don't wanna be your cheerleader no more

I I I I
I don't wanna be your cheerleader no more

I don't know what I deserve
But for you I could work

Cause I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
I don't wanna be a bird eater no more
I don't wanna be a dirt eater no more
I don't wanna be a cheerleader no more
