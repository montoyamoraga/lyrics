# Northern Lights

If you say it is
Then I guess it is
What you say it is
But I don't feel anything

Cause your pendulum
Is in swing again
Yeah your pendulum
Hasn't swung back in

It's a champagne year
Full of sober months
Through my maudlin days
Through my dry moments

I saw the northern northern lights
Convinced it was the end of times
I saw the northern northern lights

Gotta get young fast
Gotta get young quick
Gotta make this last
If it makes me sick

I saw the northern northern lights
Convinced it was the end of times
I saw the northern northern lights
Convinced it was the end of times

I saw the northern northern lights
I saw the northern northern lights
I saw the northern northern lights
I saw the northern northern lights
