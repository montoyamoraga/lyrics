# Strange Mercy

Oh little one
I know you've been tired for a long long time
And oh little one
I ain't been around for a little while
But when you see me wave

Oh little one
Your Hemingway jawline looks just like his
Our father in exile
For god only knows how many years
But when you see him wave

Through double pane
I'll be with you lost boys
Sneaking out where the shivers won't find you

Oh little one
I'd tell you good news that I don't believe
If it would help you sleep
Strange mercy

If I ever meet
The dirty policeman
Who roughed you up
No I I don't know what

If I ever meet
The dirty policeman
Who roughed you up

I'll be with you lost boys
Sneaking out where the shivers won't find you
