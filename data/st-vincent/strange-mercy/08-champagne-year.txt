# Champagne Year

So I thought I'd learned my lesson
But I secretly expected
A choir at the shore
And confetti through the falling air

I make a living telling people what they want to hear
It's not a killing but it's enough to keep the cobwebs clear

Cause it's not a perfect plan
It's not a perfect plan
But it's the one we got

It's not a perfect plan
But it's the one we got

Cause I make a living telling people what they want to hear
And boy I tell you it's gonna be a champagne year
