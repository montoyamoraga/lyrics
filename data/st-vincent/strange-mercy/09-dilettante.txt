# Dilettante

Oh Elijah
Don't make me wait
Nobody's winning
The sharks are swimming in the red

Oh Elijah
Don't make me wait
While you are sleeping
My mind goes creaking down the wall

Slow down
Dilettante
So I can limp beside you
I'm following your houndstooth

Hang on
Street savant
My bank in my back pockets
How far you think it'd take us

You're like a party I heard through a wall
I'm always watching you through a keyhole
But let's not forget
Let's not forget
Let's not forget
Why we crawled here

Oh Elijah
Don't make me wait
I got no patience
For an estrangement anyway

Wake up
Avenue C
Your hometown is still sleeping
You're like a party I heard through a wall
Invite me
I'm always watching you through a keyhole
But let's not forget
Let's not forget
Let's not forget
Where we crawled from

Oh Elijah
Don't make me wait
What is so pressing
That you can't undress me anyway
