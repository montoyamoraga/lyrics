# Hysterical Strength

Hey it's your blood
That makes my veins run
It's true
So I tried to give it back to you

Young one look at me
It's not your beast to leash
Oh don't hold more than you can stand to carry

Must have been a case
Of hysterical strength
To stand up
While the room moved off its axis

Old man look at me
Through the teeth of your grief
Oh don't grab more than you can stand to carry

Cause you went off to see
What no one else could see
Oh and left more than we could stand to bury

But it ain't
It ain't
It ain't
It ain't
It ain't
On you

No it ain't
It ain't
It ain't
It ain't
It ain't
On you

No it ain't
It ain't
It ain't
It ain't
It ain't
On you

No it ain't
It ain't
It ain't
It ain't
It ain't
On you

No it ain't
It ain't
It ain't
It ain't
It ain't
On you
