# Neutered Fruit

Did you ever really stare at me
Did you ever really stare at me
Like I stared at you

I ate flowers in the backyard
A finely neutered fruit
Shot a hundred arrows at a doe
A hundred sparrows booed

Did you ever really stare at me
Did you ever really stare
Did you ever really stare at me
Like I stared at you

Don't run
Don't run little rabbit run
Don't run
Don't run little rabbit run

Did you ever really stare at me
Did you ever really stare
Did you ever really stare at me
Like I stared at you

Did you ever ride a bear for me
Did you ever really care
Did you ever really care for me
Like I cared for you

Don't run
Don't run
Don't run
Don't run
