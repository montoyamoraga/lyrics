# Surgeon

I spent the summer on my back
Another attack
Stay in just to get along get along get along

Turn off the TV wade in bed
A blue and a red
A little something to get along get along get along
Get along get along get along

Best finest surgeon
Come cut me open

Best finest surgeon
Come cut me open

Dressing undressing for the wall
If mother calls
She knows well we don't get along get along get along

I tell the mailman never you mind
I'll sift through the piles
And for him to just get along get along get along
Get along get along get along
