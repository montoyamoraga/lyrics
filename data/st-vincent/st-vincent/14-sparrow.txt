# Sparrow

No eyes are on the sparrow
Eyes are on the sparrow
He is singing anyway

The lark keeps whistling his number
Silly little number
Although he is being chased

And no eyes are on the sparrow
Eyes are on the sparrow
How could that be the case

The lark keeps whistling his number
Silly little number
As if he isn't prey

And they're calling Maria
Momma momma Maria
They're calling Maria

No eyes are on the sparrow
Eyes are on the sparrow
I could've told you that

The finch is gathering the branches
Ignoring all the chances
The wind will blow it flat

And they're calling Maria
Momma momma Maria
They're calling Maria
