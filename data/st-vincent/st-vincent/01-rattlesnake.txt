# Rattlesnake

Follow the power lines back from the road
No one around so I take off my clothes
Am I the only one in the only world

I see the snake holes dotted in the sand
As if Seurat painted the Rio Grande
Am I the only one in the only world

Sweating sweating no wind whipping behind me
Sweating sweating no one will ever find me

The only sound out here is my own breath
And my feet stuttering to make a path
Am I the only one in the only world

Is that the wind finally picking up
Is that a rattle sounding from the brush
I'm not the only one in the only world

Running running running rattle behind me
Running running running no one will find me
Running running running rattle behind me
Running running no one will ever find me

Sweating sweating sweating rattle behind me
Running running no one will ever find me
Sweating sweating sweating rattle behind me
Running running no one will ever find me
