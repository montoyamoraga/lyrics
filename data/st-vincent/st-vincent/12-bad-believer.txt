# Bad Believer

What do you know
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know
What do you know

From the nave and down unto the altar
I left my momma sitting in the pew
Knelt before the trembling pastor
Fainted as he touched my trembling hand

What do you know
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know
What do you know

Show me your stones
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know
What do you know

Momma held me up through the rapture
Dragged me through the eyes and the whispers
Lost my spirit out the car window
Batted by righteous righteous hands

What do you know
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know
What do you know

Show me your stones
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know
What do you know

But now I'm not afraid
I know that love is stranger
Held up and writhing in the light

No I'm not ashamed
There really is no danger
Give me life
Give me life
Give me life

What do you know
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know
What do you know

Show me your stones
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know
What do you know

What do you know
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know
What do you know

Show me your stones
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know
What do you know
