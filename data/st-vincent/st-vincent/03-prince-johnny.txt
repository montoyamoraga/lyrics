# Prince Johnny

Prince Johnny you're kind but you're not simple
By now I think I know the difference
You wanna be a son of someone

Remember the time we went and snorted
That piece of the Berlin wall that you'd extorted
And we had such a laugh of it
Prostrate on my carpet

You traced the Andes with your index
And brag of when and where and who you gonna bed next
All with sons of someone's
All with sons of someone's

Saw you pray to all
To make you a real boy

Saw you pray to all
To make you a real boy

Prince Johnny you're kind but do be careful
By now I know just when to stand clear
When all your friends and acolytes are holding
Court in bathroom stalls

Where you pray to all
To make you a real boy

Saw you pray to all
To make you a real boy

But honey don't mistake my affection
For another spit and penny style redemption
Cause we're all sons of someone's
We're all sons of someone's

I wanna mean more than I mean to you
I wanna mean more than I meant to him

So I pray to all
To make me a real girl

So I pray to all
To make me a real girl

So I pray to all
All
All
All
