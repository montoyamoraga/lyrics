# Pietà

Baptized in the shallow end
Of a Holiday Inn
Limbs dangled over my pa
Like an inverse Pietà

Mother nature cried
You are leviathan my child
You are leviathan inside

And my lungs runneth over
With chlorinated water
And I pleaded with my pa
But he said I can't carry you no more

Mother nature cried
You are leviathan my child
You are leviathan inside

Mother nature sighed
What the hell is this I made this time
You are leviathan in size

Can I make a pet of you
Dress you up for all the girls
Will I keep you begging now
Or touch you with my gentle words

Mother nature cried
You are leviathan my child
You are leviathan inside

Mother nature sighed
What the hell is this I made this time
You are leviathan inside
