# Regret

Morning
Pry the windows open
Let in
What's so terrifying

Summer is as faded as a lone cicada call
Memories so bright I gotta squint just to recall

Regret
The words I've bitten
More than
The ones I ever said

Who is the one animal
All by yourself
All of us
All of us
All of us

Who is the one animal
All by yourself
All of us

Who is the one animal
All by yourself
All of us

I'm afraid of heaven because I can't stand the heights
I'm afraid of you because I can't be left behind

Oh well
There's a red moon rising
The door slammed
And it felt like a cannonball

Who is the one animal
All by yourself
All of us

Who is the one animal
All by yourself
All of us
All of us
All of us
