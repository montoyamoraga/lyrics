# Every Tear Disappears

Oh a smile is more
Than showing teeth
Oh it's not the potion
It's the magic that I seek

Every tear disappears
Every tear disappears

Oh the more that I struggle
Oh the deeper in the pit
If I can show a hand
Then I can show a fist

Call the twenty first century
Tell her give us a break

Every tear disappears
Every tear disappears

Oh and what about the pain
Don't ask me how I just
Know that it fades
Hey hey hey

Every tear disappears
Every eye is a seer

Yeah I live on wire
Yeah I've been born twice

Yeah I live on wire
Yeah I've been born twice

Yeah I live on wire
Yeah I've been born twice

Yeah I live on wire
Yeah I've been born twice

Yeah I live on wire
Yeah I've been born twice
