# Birth In Reverse

Oh what an ordinary day
Take out the garbage masturbate
I'm still holding for the laugh

The dogs will bark so let them bark
The birds will cry I let them cry
Here's my report from the edge

Like a birth in reverse
What I saw through the blinds
You could say that I'm saying
Phenomenal lies
On the cosmic eternity party line
Was a birth in reverse in America

This tune will hum me through the war
Laugh all you want but I want more
Cause what I'm swearing I never sworn before

Like a birth in reverse
What I saw through the blinds
You could say that I'm saying
Phenomenal lies
On the cosmic eternity party line
Like a birth in reverse in America

Like a birth in reverse
What I saw through the blinds
You could say that I'm saying
Phenomenal lies
On the cosmic eternity party line
Like a birth in reverse in America
