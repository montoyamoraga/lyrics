Feelings
Flash cards
Fake knife
Real ketchup

Cardboard
Cutthroats
Cowboys
Of information

Pleasure dot loathing
dot Huey dot Newton
It was a lonely lonely winter

Fuckless
Porn sharks
Toothless
But got a big bark

Live children
Blind psychics
Turned online
Assassins

So Hale Bopp hail Mary
Hail Hagia Sophia
Oh it was a lonely lonely winter

Entombed in a shrine
Of zeros and ones
You know
You know

With fatherless features
You motherless creatures
You know

In perpetual night
Oh it's terribly frightening
You know
You know

You got the pop and the hiss
In the city of misfits
You know

Safe safe and safest
Faith for the faithless
Dim dim and dimmer
Sucker for sinners

I'm entombed in a shrine
Of zeros and ones
You know
You know

With fatherless features
You motherless creatures
You know

In perpetual night
Oh it's terribly frightening
You know
You know

You got the pop and the hiss
In the city of misfits

Safe safe and safest
Faith for the faithless
