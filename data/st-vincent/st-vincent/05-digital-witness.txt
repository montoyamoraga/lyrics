# Digital Witness

Get back to your seats
Get back gnashing teeth
I want all of your mind

People turn the TV on
It looks just like a window
Yeah

People turn the TV on
It looks just like a window
Yeah

Digital witnesses
What's the point of even sleeping
If I can't show it
If you can't see me
What's the point of doing anything

This is no time
For confessing

I want all of your mind

People turn the TV on
It looks just like a window
Yeah

People turn the TV on
It looks just like a window
Yeah

Digital witnesses
What's the point of even sleeping
If I can't show it
If you can't see me
Watch me jump right off the London bridge

This is no time
For confessing

People turn the TV on
And throw it out the window
Yeah

Get back to your stare
I care but I don't care
Oh oh oh

I want all of your mind
Gimme all of your mind
I want all of your mind
Gimme all of it

Digital witnesses
What's the point of even sleeping
If I can't show it
If you can't see me
What's the point of doing anything
What's the point of even sleeping
So I stopped sleeping yeah
I stopped sleeping
Won't somebody sell me back to me
