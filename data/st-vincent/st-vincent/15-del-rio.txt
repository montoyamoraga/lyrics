# Del Rio

We were down on tenth
You told I looked spent
Gave that look you give
And rushed me to the river

Del Del Rio
Del Del Rio

We filled our cups
Drank to drinken up
Then when we were done
We threw ourselves in the river

Del Del Rio
Del Del Rio

Getting some strange looks back from the shore
And you you pinched my arm
Said look who's lucky now
And you you saved my life
Too many times to count

Del Del Rio
Del Del Rio
