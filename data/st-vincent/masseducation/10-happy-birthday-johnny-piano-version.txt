# Happy Birthday, Johnny - Piano Version

Remember one Christmas I gave you Jim Carroll
Intended it as cautionary tale
You said you saw yourself inside there
Dog eared it like a how to manual

Remember one summer we walked in Times Square
I showed you the zombies with hundred inch stares
You took a Bic set your hotel on fire
We took the blame took the bags to the train

Happy birthday Johnny
Wherever you are

Happy birthday Johnny
Wherever you are

The last time you called it was on New Years' Eve
You asked me for dough to get something to eat
Since we last spoke you live on the street
Yeah I wouldn't believe all the shit that you've seen

Happy New Year Johnny
Is it twenty three

Happy New Year Johnny
Are there lights on the trees

When I said let me think and you yelled through your teeth
Accused me of acting like all royalty
Always for show no true charity
You saw me on magazines and TV

But if they only knew the real version of me
Only you know the secrets the swamp and the fear
What happened to blood our family
Annie how could you do this to me

Of course I blame me
When you get free Johnny
I hope you find peace
