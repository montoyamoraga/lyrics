# Savior - Piano Version

You dress me up
In a nurse's outfit
It rides and sticks
To my thighs and my hips

You put me in
A teacher's little denim skirt
Ruler and desk
So I can make it hurt

But I keep you on your best behavior
Honey I can't be your savior
Love you to the grave and farther
Honey I can't be your martyr

You dress me in
A nun's black habit
Hail Mary pass
Cause you know I'll grab it

Hand me a badge
And a little billy club
Like I'm supposed
To book you on a hit and run

Adore you to the grave and further
Honey I can't be your martyr
Maybe it's just human nature
But honey I can't be your savior

But then you say
Please
Please

Dress me in leather
That's a little better
But that's still not it
None of this shit fits

But I keep you on your best behavior
Honey I can't be your savior
Love you to the grave and farther
Honey I am not your martyr

But then you say
Please
Please
Please
Please

Please
Please
Please
Please

Please
Please

You call me a strange girl yeah
You're inspecting my bruises yeah
I got them trying to save the world
You say girl you're not Jesus
