# Fear The Future - Piano Version

When the earth split in two
I was I you were you
I run for you
Run for me too

When the wall rose and fell
And the oceans all swell
I run for you
Run for me too

Come on sir just give me the answer
Come on sir now I need an answer
I won't be gone with the goners
Come on sir just give me the answer

I fear the future

When the club come and go
To the top of your skull
I run for you
What can I do

When the war started new
In our bed in our room
I come for you
Come for me too

Come on sir just give me the answer
Come on sir now I need an answer
My baby's lost to the monster
Come on sir just give me the answer

I fear the future
