# Slow Disco - Piano Version

I sway in place to a slow disco
And a glass for the saints and a bow for the road

Am I thinking what everybody's thinking
I'm so glad I came but I can't wait to leave

Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancing with a ghost

Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancing with a ghost

There's blood in my ears and a fool in the mirror
And the bay of mistakes couldn't get any clearer

Am I thinking what everybody's thinking
I'm so glad I came but I can't wait to leave

Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancing with a ghost

Slip my hand from your hand
Leave you dancing with a ghost

Don't it beat a slow dance to death
Don't it beat a slow dance to death

Don't it beat a slow dance to death
Don't it beat a slow dance to death

Don't it beat a slow dance to death
Don't it beat a slow dance to death
