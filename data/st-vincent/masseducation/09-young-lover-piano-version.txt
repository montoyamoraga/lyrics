# Young Lover  - Piano Version

How long has this been going on
I found you in the bathtub
With all your clothing on

Oh so what your mother did a number
So I get gloves of rubber
Clean up the spill

Young lover I'm begging you please to wake up
Young lover I wish that I was your drug
Young lover I miss the taste of your tongue
No I young lover I wish that love was enough enough

You say you got no room to talk babe
You're boozing on a midday and I don't see no cake
Oh but these pills I can't even pronounce them
Your thousand watts of light dim
And then you're gone again
You're gone again

Young lover I'm begging you please to wake up
Young lover I wish that I was your drug
Young lover I miss the taste of your tongue
No I young lover I wish that love was enough enough enough

We were in Paris the Eiffel was shining
All that I wanted was lying on tiling
I heard the robins I thought they were sirens
Wake up young lover I thought you were dying

I young lover
No I young lover
No I

No I young lover
No I young lover
No I

I young lover
No I young lover
No I young lover
No I young lover
