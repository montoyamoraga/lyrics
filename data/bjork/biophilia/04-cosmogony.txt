# Cosmogony

Heaven
Heaven's bodies
Whirl around me
Make me wonder

And they say back then
Our universe was an empty sea
Until a silver fox
And her cunning mate
Began to sing
A song that became
The world we know

Heaven
Heaven's bodies
Whirl around me
Make me wonder

And they say back then
Our universe was a cold black egg
Until the god inside
Burst out and from
Its shattered shell
He made what became
The world we know

Heaven
Heaven's bodies
Whirl around me
Make me wonder

And they say back then
Our universe was an endless land
Until our ancestors 
Woke up and before they went
Back to sleep they carved it all
Into the world we know

Heaven
Heaven's bodies
Whirl around me
Make me wonder

And they say back then
Our universe wasn't even there
Until a sudden bang
And then there was light
Was sound was matter
And it all became
The world we know

Heaven
Heaven's bodies
Whirl around me
And dance eternal
