# Solstice  

When your eyes pause on the ball  
That hangs on the third branch from the star  
You remember why it is dark  
And why it gets light again  

The earth like the heart slopes in its seat  
And like that it travels along an elliptical path  
Drawn into the darkness  

An unpolished pearl  
In sky-black palm of hand  
Flickering sun-flame  

And then you remember  
That you yourself  
You are a light bearer  
A light bearer  

Receiving radiance from others  
Flickering sun-flame  
Unpolished earth in the palm of hand
