# Hollow (original extended version)

Hollow
My ancestors have access
Hollow
I'm falling down the abyss
Hollow
Looking for some answers

Generations of mothers
Sailing in
Somehow they all were
Ship folks

Hollow
The ground is opening up
Swallows me up
The trunk of DNA
The trunk of DNA trunk

Listen now listen
Now come forth all humanity
And from from one race
From one race
Species to species
To species
Hollow

I'm a part of it
Hollow
Like a bead in a necklace
Thread me upon this chain
I'm part of it
The everlasting necklace
Everlasting necklace

Jewels after jewels after jewels after
Jewels after jewels after jewels

I yearn I yearn to belong
Let me belong
Let me belong
