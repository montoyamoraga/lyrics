# Mutual Core

I shuffle around
The tectonic plates
In my chest

You know
I gave it all

Trying to match
Our continents
To change seasonal drift
To form a mutual core

As fast as your fingernail grows
The Atlantic ridge drifts
To counteract distance

You know
I gave it all

Can you hear
The effort
Of the magnetic strife
Shuffling of columns
To form a mutual core

This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know that I had it in me
Withheld your love
An unspent capsule
I didn't know you had it in you

You hid the key to our continuity
I didn't know you had it in you
This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know
You didn't know

What you resist persists
Nuance makes heat
To counteract distance
I know you gave it all

Offered me harmony
If things were done your way
My Eurasian plate subsumed
Forming a mutual core

This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know I had it in me
Withheld your love
An unspent capsule
I didn't know you had it in you

This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know I had it in me

This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know
You didn't know
