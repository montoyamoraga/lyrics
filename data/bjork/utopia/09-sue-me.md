# Sue Me  

My tear duct clogged  
My left eye broken  
Medicate with warm compress  
Extract hardened tears  

Sue me sue me sue me all you want  
I won't denounce her origin  
Sue me sue me sue me all you want  
I won't denounce our origin  

I've ducked and dived  
Like the mother in Solomon's tale  
To spare our girl  
I won't let her get cut in half ever  
But it's time to teach her some dignity  

Sue me sue me sue me all you want  
I won't denounce our origin  
Sue me sue me sue me sue me  
I won't I won't denounce our origin  
No I won't  

He took it from his father  
Who took it from his father  
Who took it from his father  
Let's break this curse  

So it won't fall on our daughter  
And her daughter  
And her daughter  
Won't let this sink into her DNA  

Sue me sue me sue me  
Sue me all you want  
I won't let you denounce our origin  
Sue me sue me sue me all you want  
Denounce our origin no I won't  

Can't take her suffer  
It's so unfair  
The sins of the fathers  
They just fucked it all up  
We had the best family  
We had it all  
We had it all in our hands  
He just pulled us through the wringer  
Narcissistic
