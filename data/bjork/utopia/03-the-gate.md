# The Gate  

My healed chest wound  
Transformed into a gate  
Where I receive love from  
Where I give love from  

And I care for you care for you  
I care for you care for you  
Care for you care for you  
I care for you care for you  

Split into many parts  
Splattered light beams into prisms  
That will reunite  

If you care for me care for me  
If you care for me care for me  
Care for me care for me  

And then I'll care for you care for you  
I care for you care for you  
I care for you care for you  
I care for you care for you  

Didn't used to be so needy  
Just more broken than normal  
Proud self-sufficiency  
My silhouette is oval  
It is a gate  

I can care for you care for you from  
I can care for you care for you  
I care for you care for you  
I care for you care for you  
I care for you care for you  
You care for me care for me  
Care for you
