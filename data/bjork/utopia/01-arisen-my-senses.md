# Arisen My Senses

Just that kiss
Was all there is
Every cell in my body
Lined up for you

Legs a little open
Once again
Awaken my senses
Head topless
Arisen my senses

Just that kiss
Was all there is
My palms pulsating
Of the things
I want to do to you

Just that kiss
Is all there is
Weaving a mixtape
With every crossfade

Is W W W
For him a he
Is W W W
Once again

Weaving a mixtape
With every song

For who I am
For for with love
And with love
Awaken my senses
And with love

Just that kiss
Once again
Was all there is
Just that kiss
Once again
Arisen my senses
Was all there is
Once again
Just that kiss
Arisen my senses
Was all there is

For him a he
Once again I'm made to merge
With him for him a he
I'm made to merge
With him for him a he

Am I keen
Or keen
Or not keen

Too keen
Too seen
To be seen

With him him
He sees me for
Who I am
