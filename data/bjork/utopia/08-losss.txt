# Losss

We are all struggling
Just doing our best
We've gone through the grinder
Suffered loss

Lost to
To which everything flows
An absence which
Attracts floral
Blooming softly

Soft is
Soft is my chest
I didn't allow loss
Loss makes me hate
Didn't harden from pain

This pain we have
Will always be there
But the sense of full
Satisfaction too

I opened my heart for you
Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically
We're finally vulnerable

Loss of love
We all have suffered
How we make up for it
Defines who we who we are

It defines us
How we overcome it
Recover
Repair from loss

Loss of faith
Just ignites survivors
They stare doubt
Straight into the eye

I forgive the
Past is bondage
Freedom aphrodisiac
Aphrodisiac

I've opened my heart for you
Tied ribbons on my ankles for you
Drew orchids on my thighs for you
Your lower lip so heavy on you

My spine curved erotically
Tied ribbons on my ankles for you
Drew orchids on my thighs for you
Your lower lip so heavy on you

My spine curved erotically
We're finally vulnerable
