# Features Creatures

When I spot someone who is the same height as you
And goes to same record stores
I literally think I am five minutes away from love

When I hear someone with same accent as yours
Asking directions with the same beard as yours
I literally think I am five minutes away from love

Isn't it odd
Isn't it peculiar
These statistics of my mind
Shuffling your features
Assembling a man
Googling love
Warming my heart on this log fire of love

Features creatures

His orifices
