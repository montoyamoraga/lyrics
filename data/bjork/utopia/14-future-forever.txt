# Future Forever

Imagine a future
And be in it

Feels this incredible nurture
Soak it in

Your past is on loop
Turn it off

See this possible future
And be in it

Hold fort for love forever
We're just momentary vessels
We're just carrying

Trust your head
Around

Guide your stare
Elsewhere

Your love is
Already waiting

You're already
In it

Hold fort for love forever
Forever

Watch me
Form new nests
Weave
A matriarchal dome

Build a musical
Scaffolding
Between sleep
And awake

Day and night
Between night and day

You say I mirror
People's missions at them

Now you mirror at me
Who I used to be

What I gave to the world
You've given back to me

Hold fort for love
Forever
