# Courtship  

He turned me down I then downturned another  
Who then downturned her  
The paralyzing juice of rejection  
His veins full of lead  
He's left with loving what he lost  
More than what he has  

My snakeskin cold in the dark  
But warms up in the light  
I then upturned a green eyed giant  
Who upturned me and entered me  
Will we stop seeing what unites us  
But only what differs  

The ghosts of old loves  
Hovering around his orifices  
His orifices  

As you narrate your own heart tale  
Your thread souls into one beam  
The love you gave and have been given  
Weave into your own dream  
I trust my cells to re archive  
My love historic stream
