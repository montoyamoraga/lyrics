# Triumph of a Heart  

The nerves  
Are sending  
Shimmering signals  
All through my fingers  

The veins support  
Blood that gushes  
Impulsively towards  

The triumph of a heart  
That gives all  
That gives all  

The triumph of a heart  
That gives all  
That gives all  

The stubborn trunks  
Of these legs of mine  
Serve as pathways  
For my favorite fuel  

Heading upwards  
Towards my kidneys  

The triumph of a heart  
That gives all  
That gives all  

The triumph of a heart  
That gives all  
That gives all  

Smooth soft red  
Velvety lungs  
Are pushing a network  
Of oxygen joyfully  
Through a nose  
Through a mouth  
But all enjoys  

The triumph of a heart  
That gives all  
That gives all  

The triumph of a heart  
That gives all  
That gives all  

The triumph of a heart  
That gives all  
That gives all  

The triumph of a heart  
That gives all  
That gives all
