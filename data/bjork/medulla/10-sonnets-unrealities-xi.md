# Sonnets/Unrealities XI  

It may not always be so  
And I say and if your lips  
Which I have loved  
Should touch another's  
And your dear strong fingers clutch  
Her heart  
As mine in time not far away  
If on another's face your sweet hair lay  
In such a silence as I know  
Or such great writhing words as  
Uttering over much  
Stand helplessly before the spirit at bay  
If this should be  
I say if this should be  
You of my heart  
Send me a little word  
That I may go unto her  
And take her hands saying  
Accept al happiness from me  
Then I shall turn my face  
And hear one bird  
Sing terribly afar  
In the lost lands
