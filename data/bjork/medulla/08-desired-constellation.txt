# Desired Constellation

It's tricky when
You feel someone
Has done something
On your behalf

It's slippery when
Your sense of justice
Murmurs underneath
And is asking you

How am I going to make it right
How am I going to make it right

With a palm full of stars
I throw them like dice
Repeatedly
On the table
Repeatedly

I shake them like dice
And throw them on the table
Repeatedly
Repeatedly
Until the desired constellation appears

How am I going to make it right
How am I going to make it right
How am I going to make it right

And you hear
How am I going to make it right
How am I going to make it right

How
How am I going to make it right

How
How am I going to make it right
