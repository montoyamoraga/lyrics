# Oceania  

One breath away from mother Oceania  
Your nimble feet make prints  
In my sands  

You have done  
Good for yourselves  
Since you left  
My wet embrace  
And crawled ashore  

Every boy  
Is a snake  
Is a lily  

Every pearl  
Is a lynx  
Is a girl  

Sweet like harmony  
Made into flesh  

You dance  
By my side  
Children sublime  

You show me continents  
I see the islands  
You count the centuries  
I blink my eyes  

Hawks and sparrows  
Race in my waters  
Stingrays are floating  
Across the sky  

Little ones  
My sons and my daughters  

Your sweat is salty  
I am why  

I am why  
I am why  

Your sweat is salty  
I am why  

I am why  
I am why
