# Where Is The Line

Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you

My purse wide open
You ask again
I see you trying to
Cash into accounts everywhere

Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you

I want to be flexible
I want to go out
Of my way for you
But enough is enough

Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you

I am elastic
I want to go out
Of my way for you
I want to help you

Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you

I want to have
Capacity for you
And be elastic
To be elastic
Elastic for you

Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you

I'm elastic for you
But enough
Is enough

Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you
Where is the line with you
