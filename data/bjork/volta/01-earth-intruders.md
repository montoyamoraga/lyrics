# Earth Intruders

We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches

Turmoil
Carnage

Here come the earth intruders
We are the paratroopers
Stampede of sharp shooters
Come straight from voodoo

With our feet thumping
With our feet marching
Grinding skeptics
Into the soil

Shower of goodness coming to end
The doubt pouring over
Shower of goodness coming to end

We are the earth intruders
We are the sharp shooters
Flock of parachuters
Necessary voodoo

I have
Guided my bones
Through some voltage
And love them still
And love them too

Metallic
Carnage
Furiocity
Feel the speed

We are the earth intruders
We are the sharp shooters
Flock of parachuters
Necessary voodoo

There is
Turmoil
Out there
Carnage
Rambling

What is to do
But dig
Dig bones
Out of earth

Mud graves
Timber
Morbid
Trenches

Here come the earth intruders
There'll be no resistance
WE are the canoneerers
Necessary voodoo

And the beast
With many heads
And the arms rolling
Steamroller

We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches

Forgive us tribe

We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches

We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
We are the earth intruders

We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Marching

We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Marching

Marching
Marching
