# The Dull Flame Of Desire  

I love your eyes my dear  
Their splendid sparkling fire  

When suddenly you raise them so  
To cast a swift embracing glance  

Like lightning flashing in the sky  
But there's a charm that is greater still  

When my love's eyes are lowered  
When all is fired by passion's kiss  

And through the downcast lashes  
I see the dull flame of desire  

And through the downcast lashes  
I see the dull flame of desire  

I love your eyes my dear  
Their splendid sparkling fire  

When suddenly you raise them so  
To cast a swift embracing glance  

Like lightning flashing in the sky  
But there's a charm that is greater still  

When my love's eyes are lowered  
When all is fired by passion's kiss  

And through the downcast lashes  
I see the dull flame of desire  

And through the downcast lashes  
I see the dull flame of desire  

Dull flame  
I see the dull flame of desire  
I see the dull flame  
I see the dull flame  

Oh I love your eyes my dear  
Their splendid sparkling fire  

When suddenly you raise them so  
To cast a swift embracing glance  

Like lightning flashing in the sky  
But there's a charm that is greater still  

When my love's eyes are lowered  
When all is fired by passion's kiss  

And through the downcast lashes  
I see the dull flame of desire  

Through the downcast lashes  
I see the dull flame of desire  

See the dull flame  
I see the full flame of  
I see the dull flame  
I see the full flame  

I love your eyes my dear  
Their splendid sparkling fire  

When suddenly you raise them so  
To cast a swift embracing glance  

Like lightning flashing in the sky  
There's a charm that is greater still  

When my love's eyes are lowered  
When all is fired by passion's kiss  

Through the downcast lashes  
I see the dull flame of desire  

And through the downcast lashes  
I see the dull flame of desire  

And through the  
Downcast lashes  
I see the  
Dull flame  
Of desire
