# Wanderlust

I am leaving this harbor
Giving urban a farewell
Its habitants seem too keen on God
I cannot stomach their rights and wrongs

I have lost my origin
And I don't want to find it again
Whether sailing into nature's laws
And be held by ocean paws

Wanderlust
Relentlessly craving
Wanderlust
Peel off the layers

Until we get to the core
Did I imagine it would be like this
Was it something like this I wished for
Or will I want more

Lust for comfort
Suffocates the soul
Relentless restlessness
Relentless restlessness
Liberates me sets me free
I feel at home
Whenever the unknown surrounds me
I receive its embrace
Aboard my floating house

Wanderlust
Relentlessly craving
Wanderlust
Peel off the layers

Until we get to the core
Did I imagine it would be like this
Was it something like this I wished for
Or will I want more

Wanderlust
From island to island
Wanderlust
United in movement
Wonderful
I'm joined with you

Wanderlust
Wanderlust
Can you spot a pattern

Relentlessly restless

Restless relentlessly
Restless relentlessly
Restless relentlessly
Restless relentlessly

Restless relentlessly
Restless relentlessly
Restless relentlessly
Restless relentlessly

Restless relentlessly
Restless relentlessly
Restless relentlessly
Restless relentlessly

Can you spot a pattern
Can you
