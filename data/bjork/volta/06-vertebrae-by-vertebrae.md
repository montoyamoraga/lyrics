# Vertebrae By Vertebrae  

Up on the toe  
There is a view  
Up on the toe  
And the spine  

Straight and erect  
Hungry and curious  
Up on the toe  
Looking forward to  

The air is thinner here  

She came here  
To lose face  
Got down on her knees  
The beast is back  

On four legs  
Set her clock to the moon  
Raises her spine  

Vertebrae by vertebrae  
Up on the toe  
Looking  

I have been filled with  
Steam for months for years  
Same old cloud  
Claustrophobic me  

Let it burst   
Like old train sounds  
Make them leave me nature  

Vertebrae  
By vertebrae  
By vertebrae  
By vertebrae  
By vertebrae  

My arms squeeze out of my shoulders  
And the arms squeeze out of my shoulders  
I curl my tail inwards inwards  
I set my clock on the moon  

Vertebrae by vertebrae  

Please release this pressure of me  
Please release this pressure of me  
Please release this pressure of me  
Please let off some steam
