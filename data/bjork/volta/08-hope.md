# Hope  

Here's my version of it  
Eternal whirlwind  

Here's my version of it  
Eternal whirlwind  

Here's my version of it  
Eternal whirlwind  

What's the lesser  
Of two evils  
If a suicide bomber  
Made to look pregnant  

Manages to kill her  
Target or not  
What's the lesser  
Of two evils  

What's the lesser  
Of two evils  
If she kills them  
Or dies in vain  

Nature has fixed  
no limits  
on our hopes  
Oh what's the lesser  
Of two evils  

What's the lesser  
Of two evils  
If her bump was fake  
Or if it was real  

Here's my version of it  
Eternal whirlwind  
I have fostered  
Since childhood  

Well I don't care  
Love is all  
I dare to drown  
To be proven wrong
