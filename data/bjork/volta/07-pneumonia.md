# Pneumonia

Get over the sorrow girl
The world is always
Going to be
Made of this

You can
Trust in it
Unless you
Breathe in
Bravely

I adore how you
Simply
Surrender
To high
High

And your lungs
They're mourning
T B style

All the stillborn love that could've happened
All the moments you should have embraced
All the moments you should have not locked up

Understand
So clearly
To shut yourself up
Would be the hugest
Crime of them all

You're just crying
After all
You're just crying
After all

To not want them
Humans around
Anymore

Get over
That sorrow girl
Get over it
