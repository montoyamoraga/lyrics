# I See Who You Are  

I see  
Who you are  
Behind the skin  
And the muscles  

I see  
Who you are now  
And when you get  
Older later  

I will see the same girl  
The same soul  
Lioness  
Fire heart  
Passionate lover  

And afterwards  
Later this century  
When you and I  
Have become corpses  

Let's celebrate now  
All this flesh on our bones  
Let me push you up  
Against me tightly  
And enjoy  
Every bit of you  

Let's celebrate now  
All this flesh on our bones  
Let me push you up  
Against me tightly  
And enjoy  
Every bit of you  

Let's celebrate now  
All this flesh on our bones  
And enjoy  
Every bit of you  

I see  
Who you are  

I see  
Who you are
