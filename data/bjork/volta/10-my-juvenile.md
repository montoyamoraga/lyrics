# My Juvenile  

Down the corridor  
I send warmth  
I send warmth  

Down the staircase  
I send warmth  
I send warmth  

Thank you  
For again  
To get to be able  
To send warmth  
To send warmth  

Perhaps I set you too free  
Too fast  
Too young  

But the intentions were pure  
But the intentions were pure  

My juvenile  
My juvenile  
My juvenile  

I truly say  
You are  
My biggest love  
I clumsily try to  
Free you from me  
One last embrace  
To tie a sacred ribbon  

This is an offer  
To better the last let go  

This is an offer  
To better the last let go  

This is an offer  
To better the last let go  

The intentions were pure  

My juvenile  
My juvenile  
My juvenile  
My juvenile  

My juvenile  
My juvenile  
My juvenile  
My juvenile
