# Hunter

If travel is searching
And home what's been found
I'm not stopping

I'm going hunting
I'm the hunter
I'll bring back the woods
But I don't know when

I thought I could organise freedom
How Scandinavian of me
You sussed it out didn't you

You could smell it
So you left me on my own
To complete the mission
Now I'm leaving it all behind

I'm going hunting
I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter
I'm going hunting

I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter

I'm the hunter
