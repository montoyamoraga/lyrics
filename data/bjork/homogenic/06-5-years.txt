# 5 Years

You think you're denying me of something
Well I've got plenty
You're the one who's missing out
But you won't notice

Until after five years
If you'll live that long
You'll wake up
All loveless

I dare you
To take me on
I dare you
To show me your palms

I'm so bored
With cowards
That say they want
Then they can't handle

You can't handle love
You can't handle love
You just can't handle

I dare you
To take me on
I dare you
To show me your palms

What's so scary
Not a threat in sight
You just can't handle
You can't handle love

You can't handle love
Baby you can't handle love
It's obvious
You can't handle

I dare you
To take me on
I dare you
To show me your palms

I'm so bored
With cowards
That say they want
Then they can't handle

You can't handle love
Baby you can't handle love
It's obvious
You can't handle

I dare you
I dare you
I dare you
I dare you
