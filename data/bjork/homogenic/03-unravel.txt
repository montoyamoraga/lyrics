# Unravel

While you are away
My heart comes undone
Slowly unravels
In a ball of yarn

The devil collects it
With a grin
Our love
In a ball of yarn

He'll never return it
So when you come back
We'll have to make new love

He'll never return it
So when you come back
We'll have to make new love

While you are away
My heart comes undone
Slowly unravels
In a ball of yarn

The devil collects it
With a grin
Our love our love
In a ball of yarn

He'll never return it
So when you come back
We'll have to make new love

He'll never return it
So when you come back
We'll have to make new love

He'll never return it
So when you come back
We'll have to make new love

He'll never return it
So when you come back
We'll have to make new love
