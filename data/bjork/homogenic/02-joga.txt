All these accidents that happen
Follow the dot
Coincidence makes sense
Only with you
You don't have to speak
I feel

Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
The riddle gets solved
And you push me up to

This state of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be

All that no one sees
You see what's inside of me
Every nerve that hurts
You heal deep inside of me
You don't have to speak
I feel

Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
Confuse
The riddle gets solved
And you push me up to

This state of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be
State of emergency
How beautiful to be

Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
The riddle gets solved
And you push me up to

This state of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be
State of emergency
How beautiful to be

State of emergency
State of

State of
How beautiful
Emergency
Is where I want to be

State of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be
State of emergency
