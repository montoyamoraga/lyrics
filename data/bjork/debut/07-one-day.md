# One Day  

One day it will happen  
One day one day  
It will all come true  

One day when you're ready  
One day one day  
When you're up to it  

The atmosphere  
Will get lighter  
And two suns ready  
To shine just for you  

I can feel it  
I can feel it  

One day it will happen  
One day one day  
It will all make sense  

One day you will blossom  
One day one day  
When you're ready  

One day one day  

An aeroplane  
Will curve gracefully  
Around the volcano  
With the eruption  
That never lets you down  

I can feel it  
I can feel it  

And the beautifulest  
Fireworks are burning  
In the sky  
Just for you  

I can feel it  
I can feel it  

One day one day one day  
One day one day one day  

One day one day one day  
One day one day one day  

It will all come true  

One day one day one day  
One day one day one day
