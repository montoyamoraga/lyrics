# Aeroplane

I can not live
Peacefully without you
For even a moment
I miss you terribly
When you're away

He's away
This ain't right
I'm alone
I'm taking an aeroplane
Across the world
To follow my heart

How come out of all the people in the world
Only one can make me complete
One word one word on the phone
Makes me happy
One touch but one touch
Directly makes me ecstatic

He's away
This ain't right
I'm alone
I'm taking an aeroplane
Across the world
To follow my heart
