# Violently Happy  

Since I met you  
This small town  
Hasn't got room  
For my big feelings  

Violently happy  
Cause I love you  
Violently happy  
But you're not here  
Violently happy  
Come calm me down  
Before I get into trouble  

I tip toe down to the shore  
Stand by the ocean  
Make it roar at me  
And I roar back  

Violently happy  
Cause I love you  
Violently happy  
But you're not here  
Violently happy  
Overemotional  
Violently happy  
I'll get in trouble  
Real soon  
If you don't get here  
Baby  

Violently happy  
Cause I love you  
Violently happy  
I'm aiming too high  
Violently happy  
It will get me into trouble  
Violently happy  
I'm driving my car too fast  
With ecstatic music on  

Violently happy  
I'm getting too drunk  
Violently happy  
I'm daring people  
To jump off roofs with me  
Only you can calm me down  
I'm aiming too high  
Soothe me
