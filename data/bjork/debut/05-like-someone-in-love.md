# Like Someone In Love

Lately
I find myself
Out gazing at stars
Hearing guitars
Like someone in love

Sometimes the things I do
Astound me
Mostly whenever
You're around me

Lately
I seem to walk
As though I have wings
Bump into things
Like someone in love

Each time I look at you
I'm limp as a glove
And feeling
Like someone in love

Sometimes the things I do
Astound me
Mostly whenever
You're around me

Lately
I seem to walk
As though I have wings
Bump into things
Like someone in love

Each time I look at you
I'm limp as a glove
And feeling
Like someone in love
Like someone in love
