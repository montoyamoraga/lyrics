# Mouth Mantra

My throat was stuffed
My mouth was sewn up
Banned from making noise
I was not heard

Remove this hindrance
My throat feels stuck
I was not allowed
I was not heard
I was not heard
I was not heard
I was not heard

There is vocal sadness
I was separated
From what I can do
What I'm capable of

Need to break up
Vicious habits
Do something I haven't done
I haven't done before

In vow of silence
I explore the negative space
Around my mouth
It implodes
Black hole
With jaw fallen in
In fallen jaw
Jaw fallen in
I am not hurt
I am not hurt

This tunnel has enabled
Thousands of sounds
I thank this trunk
Noise pipe noise pipe

I have followed a path
That took sacrifices
Now I sacrifice this scar
Can you cut it off
