# Black Lake

Our love was my womb
But our bond has broken
My shield is gone
My protection is taken
I am one wound
My pulsating body
Suffering being

My heart is enormous lake
Black with potion
I am blind
Drowning in this ocean

My soul torn apart
My spirit is broken
Into the fabric of all
He is woven

Your fear my limitless options
I am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions
Did I love you too much
Devotion bent me broken
So I rebelled
Destroyed the icon

I did it for love
I honored my feelings
You betrayed your own heart
Corrupted that organ

Family was always
Our sacred mutual mission
Which you abandoned

You have nothing to give
Your heart is hollow
I'm drowned in sorrows
No hope in sight of ever recover
Eternal pain and horrors

I am a glowing shiny rocket
Returning home
As I enter the atmosphere
I burn off layer by layer
