# Stonemilker  

A juxtapositioning fate  
Find our mutual coordinates  

Moments of clarity are so rare  
I better document this  
At last the view is fierce  
All that matters is  

Who is open chested  
And who has coagulated  
Who can share  
Who has shut down the chances  

Show me emotional respect  
Oh respect oh respect  

And I have emotional needs  
Oh needs ooh ooh ooh  

I wish to synchronize our feelings  
Our feelings oh ooh ooh  

What is it that I have  
That makes me feel your pain  
Like milking a stone  
To get you to say it  

Who is open  
And who has shut up  
And if one feels closed  
How does one stay open  

We have emotional needs  
Oh needs ooh ooh ooh  

I wish to synchronize our feelings  
Our feelings oohh ooh ooh ooh   

Oh show  emotional respect  
Oh respect oh ooh ooh  

A juxtapositioning fate  
Find our mutual coordinates
