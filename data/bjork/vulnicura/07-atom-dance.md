# Atom Dance

We are each other's hemispheres

I am fine tuning my soul
To the universal wavelength
No one is a lover alone
I propose an atom dance

Our hearts are coral reefs in low tide
Love is the ocean we crave
Restlessly turning around and around
I am dancing towards transformation

Learning by love to open it up
Let this ugly wound breathe
We fear unconditional heart space
Healed by atom dance

When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me

We are each other's hemispheres

We aim at peeling off
Dead layers of loveless love

No one is a lover alone
Most hearts fear their own home
Most hearts they fear their own home

Becoming themselves fully
It scares them off

When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me

No one is a lover alone lone
Most hearts fear their own home
You are my second hemisphere hemisphere
The atoms are dancing dancing

No one is a lover alone lone
Most hearts fear their own home
You are my second hemisphere hemisphere
The atoms are dancing dancing

Atoms are laughing at last
Atoms are laughing at last
At last
At last
Atoms are

No one is a lover alone
No one is a lover alone lone
Most hearts fear their own home
You are my second hemisphere hemisphere
The atoms are dancing dancing
