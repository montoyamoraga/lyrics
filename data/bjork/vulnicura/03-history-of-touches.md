# History of Touches

I wake you up
In the middle of the night
To express my love for you
Stroke your skin and feel you
Naked I can feel all of you
At the same moment

I wake you up
In the night feeling
This is our last time together
Therefore sensing all the moments
We've been together
Being here at the same time
Every single touch
We ever touch each other
Every single fuck
We had together
Is in a wondrous time lapse
With us here at this moment
The history of touches
Every single archive
Compressed into a second
All with us here as I wake you up
