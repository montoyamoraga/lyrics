# Lionsong

Maybe he will come out of this
Maybe he won't
Somehow I'm not too
Bothered either way

Maybe he will out of this loving me
Maybe he will come out of this
I smell declarations of solitude
Maybe he will come out of this

Vietnam vet comes after the war
Lands in my house
This wild lion doesn't fit in this chair

Maybe he will out of this loving me
Maybe he won't
I'm not taming an animal
Maybe he will come out of this

Once it was simple
One feeling at a time
It reached its peak then transformed
These abstract complex feelings
I just don't know how to handle them

Should I throw oil on one of these moods
But which one
The joy peak
Humor peak
Frustration peak
Anything peak
For clarity

Maybe he will out of this loving me
Maybe he won't
I'm not taming no animal
Maybe he will come out of this

Maybe he will out of this
Maybe he won't

Somehow I'm not too bothered either way
Somehow I'm not too bothered either way

I refuse
It's a sign of maturity
To be stuck in complexity
I demand all clarity

Maybe he will come out of this
Or he will feel solitaire
Somehow I'm not too bothered
I'd just like to know
