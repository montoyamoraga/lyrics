# Scatterheart  

Black night is falling  
The sun is gone to bed  
The innocent are dreaming  
As you should sleepy head  
Sleep heady sleepy head  

All the love above  
I send into you  
Comfort and protection  
I'll watch over you  

But don't ask me  
What's gonna happen next  
I know the future  
I'd love to lead you the way  
Just to make it easier on you  

You are gonna have to find out for yourself  
You are gonna have to find out for yourself  
You are gonna have to find out for yourself  
You are gonna have to find out for yourself  

My dearest scatterheart  
There is comfort  
Right in the eye  
Of the hurricane  
Just to make it easier on you  

You are gonna have to find out for yourself  
You are gonna have to find out for yourself  
You are gonna have to find out for yourself  
You are gonna have to find out for yourself  

All the hurt in the world  
You know  
There's nothing I'd love to do more  
Than spare you from that burden  
It's gonna be hard  

If I only could  
Shelter you  
From that pain  
Just to make it easier on you  

You are gonna have to find out for yourself  
You are gonna have to find out for yourself  
You are gonna have to find out for yourself  
You are gonna have to find out for yourself  

You are gonna have to find out for yourself  
You are gonna have to find out for yourself  
You are gonna have to find out for yourself  
You are gonna have to find out for yourself
