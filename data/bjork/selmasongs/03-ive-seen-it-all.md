# I've Seen It All  

I've seen it all
I have seen the trees  
I have seen the willow leaves  
Dancing in the breeze  

I've seen a man killed  
By his best friend  
And lives that were over  
Before they were spent  

I've seen what I was  
and I know what I'll be  
I've seen it all  
There is no more to see  

You haven't seen elephants  
Kings or Peru  
I'm happy to say  
I had better to do  

What about China  
Have you seen the Great Wall  
All walls are great  
If the roof doesn't fall  

And the man you will marry  
The home you will share  
To be honest  
I really don't care  

You've never been  
To Niagara Falls  
I have seen water  
It's water that's all

The Eifell Tower  
The Empire State  
My pulse was as high  
On my very first date  

Your grandson's hand  
As he plays with your hair  
To be honest  
I really don't care  

I've been seen it all  
I've seen the dark  
I've seen the brightness  
In one little spark  

I've seen what I chose  
And I've seen what I need  
And that is enough  
To want more would be greed  

I've seen what I was  
And I know what I'll be  
I've seen it all  
There is no more to see  

You've seen it all  
And all you have seen  
You can always review  
On your own little screen  

The light and the dark  
The big and the small  
Just keep in mind  
You need no more at all  

You've seen what you were  
And know what you'll be  
You've seen it all  
There is no more to see
