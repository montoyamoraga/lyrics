# New World  

Train whistles  
A sweet clementine  
Blueberries  
Dancers in line  
Cobwebs  
A bakery sign  


Ooh ooh  
A sweet clementine  
Ooh ooh  
Dancers in line  
Ooh ooh  

If living is seeing  
I'm holding my breath  
In wonder I wonder  
What happens next  
A new world  
A new day to see  

See  
See  

I'm softly
Walking on air  
Halfway to  
Heaven from here  
Sunlight  
Unfolds in my hair  

Ooh ooh  
I'm walking on air  
Ooh ooh  
To heaven from here  
Ooh ooh  

If living is seeing  
I'm holding my breath  
In wonder I wonder  
What happens next  
A new world  
A new day to see  

See  
See  
To see  
See  
See
