# Cvalda

Clatter crash clack
Racket bang thump
Rattle clang crack
Thud whack bam

Clatter crash clack
Racket bang thump
Rattle clang crack
Thud whack bam

It's music
Now dance

Listen Cvalda
You're the dancer
You've got the sparkle
In your eyes

Look at me
Entrancer

Clatter crash clack
Racket bang thump
Rattle clang crack
Thud whack bam

The clatter machines
They greet you and say
We tap out a rhythm
And sweep you away

A clatter machine
What a magical sound
A room full of noises
That spins you around

Darling Selma
Look who's dancing
Faster than a
Shooting star

Cvalda's here
Cvalda sings

Clatter crash clack
Racket bang thump
Rattle clang crack
Thud whack bam

Clatter crash clack
Racket bang thump
Rattle clang crack
Thud whack bam

The clatter machines
They greet you and say
We tap out a rhythm
And sweep you away

A clatter machine
What a magical sound
A room full of noises
That spins you around

It spins us around
It spins us around
It spins us around
