# Cocoon  

Who would have known  
That a boy like him  
Would have entered me lightly  
Restoring my blisses  

Who would have known  
That a boy like him  
After sharing my core  
Would stay going nowhere  

Who would have known  
A beauty this immense  
Who would have known  
A saintly trance  

Who would have known  
Miraculous breath  
To inhale a beard  
Loaded with courage  

Who would have known  
That a boy like him  
Possessed of magical sensitivity  

Who would approach  
A girl like me  
Who caresses cradles  
His head in her bosom  

He slides inside  
Half awake half asleep  
We faint back  
Into sleephood  

When I wake up  
The second time  
In his arms  
Gorgeousness  
He's still inside me  


Who would have known  
Who  
Who would have known  

A train of pearls
Cabin by cabin  
Is shot precisely  
Across an ocean  

From a mouth  
From a  
From the mouth  
Of a girl like me  

To a boy  
To a boy  
To a boy
