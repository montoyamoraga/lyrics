# Unison

One hand
Loves the other
So much on me

Born stubborn me
Will always be
Before you count
One two three
I will have grown
My own private branch
Of this tree

You gardener
You discipliner
Domestically
I can obey
All of your rules
And still be be

I never thought I would compromise
I never thought I would compromise
I never thought I would compromise

Let's unite tonight
We shouldn't fight
Embrace you tight
Let's unite tonight

I thrive best
Hermit style
With a beard
And a pipe

And a parrot
On each side
But now I can't
Do this without you

I never thought I would compromise
I never thought I would compromise
I never thought I would compromise

Let's unite tonight
We shouldn't fight
Embrace you tight
Let's unite tonight

One hand
Loves the other
So much on me

Let's unite tonight
We shouldn't fight
Embrace you tight
Let's unite tonight

Let's unite tonight
We shouldn't fight
Embrace you tight
Let's

Unison
