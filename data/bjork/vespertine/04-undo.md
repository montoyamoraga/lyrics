# Undo

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
Oh I

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
Oh I

You're trying too hard
Surrender
Give yourself in
You're trying too hard
You're trying too hard
Ah

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
Sweetly

It's not meant to be a strife
To enjoy
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
Oh I-

It's warmer now
Lean into it
Unfold
Unfold in a generous way
Surrender

It's not meant to be a strife
Surrender
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
Undo

It's not meant to be a strife
Strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

I'm praying
To be in a generous mode
The kindness kind
The kindness kind
To share me
To share me

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

Undo
Undo
If you're bleeding

Undo
And if you're sweating

Undo
If you're crying
Darling

Undo
Undo
Oh I
Unravel
