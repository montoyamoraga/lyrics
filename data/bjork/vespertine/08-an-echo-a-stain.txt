# An Echo A Stain

She touched my arm
And smiled
One of these days
Soon very soon

Love you til then
Love you til then

Feel my breath
On your neck
And your heart
Will race

Don't say no to me
You can't say no to me
I won't see you
Denied

I'm sorry you saw that
I'm sorry he did it
An echo
A stain
A stain

I can't say no to you
I can't say no to you
Say nothing

Free falling
Complete
