I wish I want to stay here
I wish this be enough
I wish I only love you
I wish simplicity

Look at the speed out there
It magnetizes me to it
And I have no fear
I'm only into this to

Enjoy

I wish I'd only look
And didn't have to touch
I wish I'd only smell this
And didn't have to taste

How can I ignore
This is sex without touching
I'm going to explore
I'm only into this to
