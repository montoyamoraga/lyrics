# Modern Things  

All the modern things  
Like cars and such  
Have always existed  

They've just been waiting
In a mountain  
For the right moment  

Listening to the irritating noises  
Of dinosaurs and people  
Dabbling outside  

All the modern things  
Have always existed  
They've just been waiting

To come out  
And multiply  
And take over  

It's their turn now
