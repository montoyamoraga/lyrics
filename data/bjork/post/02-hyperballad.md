# Hyperballad

We live on a mountain
Right at the top
There's a beautiful view
From the top of the mountain

Every morning I walk towards the edge
And throw little things off
Like car parts bottles and cutlery
Or whatever I find lying around

It's become a habit
A way to start the day

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

It's early morning
No one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off

I listen to the sounds they make
On their way down
I follow with my eyes till they crash
I imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks

And when it lands
Will my eyes be closed or open

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you

Safe up here
Safe up here
Safe up here 
Safe up here

Safe up here
Safe up here
Safe up here 
Safe up here

Safe up here
Safe up here
Safe up here 
Safe up here

Safe up here
Safe up here
Safe up here 
Safe up here
