# Possibly Maybe  

You flirt  
It finds me out  
Teases the crack in me  
Smittens me with hope  

Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  

As much as I definitely enjoy solitude  
I wouldn't mind perhaps  
Spending little time with you  
Sometimes sometimes  

Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  
Probably love  
Possibly maybe  

Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  
Probably love  
Possibly maybe  

Uncertainty excites me baby  
Who knows what's going to happen  
Lottery or car crash  
Or you'll join a cult  

Probably maybe  
Possibly maybe  
Possibly love  
Possibly maybe  

This is probably maybe  
Possibly maybe  
Possibly love  
Possibly  

Mon petit vulcan  
Your eruptions and disasters  
I keep calm  
Admiring your lava I keep calm  

Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  
Probably love  
Possibly maybe  

Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  
Probably love  
Possibly maybe  

Electric shocks I love them  
With you a dozen day  
But after a while I wonder  
Where's that love you promised me  
Where is it  

Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  
Probably love  
Possibly  

Possibly possibly  
Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  
Probably love  
Possibly  

How can you offer me love like that  
My heart's burned  
How can you offer me love like that  
I'm exhausted leave me alone  

Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  

Since we broke up  
I'm using lipstick again  
I suck my tongue  
In remembrance of you  

Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  

Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  

Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe  
Possibly maybe
