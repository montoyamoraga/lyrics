# Gratitude

July Thirteenth
Nineteen fourty-six

Dear General MacArthur

With your permission
I offer wishes of good health
During this heat
That burns anything

The words I slowly put
Together
Do not flow easily
They only fill my heart

Recently fulfilling
Your heart's desire
You removed the whaling
Moratorium

Your gesture brings
A much needed food
To our community
And families

The words I slowly put
Together
Do not flow easily
They only fill my heart

A million year old fossil
I send to you
This comes from my family
And the ancient sea

A prehistoric impression
Of the modern krill
She feeds the noble whale
And offers you longevity

The words I slowly put
Together
Do not flow easily
They only fill my heart

Finally
Please take good care
In the heat

Sincerely yours
Shizuka
