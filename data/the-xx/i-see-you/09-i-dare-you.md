# I Dare You  

I'm in love with it  
Intoxicated  
I'm in rapture  
From the inside  
I can feel that you want to  

Wake up high on it  
Feel it suspending  
I'm enamored  
Way up in the sky  
I can see that you want to  

I've been a romantic for so long  
All I've ever heard are love songs  

Singing  
Oh oh oh  
Go on I dare you  
Oh oh oh  
I dare you  

I get chills  
Heart rate multiplies  
I'm on a different kind of high  

A rush of blood  
Is not enough  
I need my feelings set on fire  

Now I'm deep in it  
Infatuated  
Strong attraction  

Side by side  
And I know that you want to  

I've been a romantic for so long  
All I've ever heard are love songs  

Singing  
Oh oh oh  
Go on I dare you  
Oh oh oh  
I dare you  

I can hear it now like I heard it then  
I can hear it now like I heard it then  

I can hear it now like I heard it then  
I can hear it now like I heard it then  

Singing  
Oh oh oh  
Go on I dare you  
Oh oh oh  
I dare you  

Oh oh oh  
Go on I dare you  
Oh oh oh  
I dare you
