# Lips

Just your love
Just your shadow
Just your voice
And my soul

Just your love
Just your shadow
Just your voice
And my soul
Just your lips

My name on your lips
Your air in my lungs
Drowned in oxygen

Now you've set the scene
High on intimacy
Drawing me above

Ooh ooh
I don't wanna know the way down

Ooh ooh
I don't wanna know the way down

Just your love
I just want it all
Just your shadow
Just your voice
I just want it all
And my soul

In my head in my veins
In the way you give and take
In the weight that you weigh
On my body on my brain

Chemistry is rare
In a two three time affair
There's no guarantees

Working through the seasons
Pressed up against the ceiling
Pushing down on me

Ooh ooh
I don't wanna know the way down

Ooh ooh
I don't wanna know the way down

Just your love
I just want it all
Just your shadow
Just your voice
I just want it all
And my soul

In my head in my veins
In the way you give and take
In the weight that you weigh
On my body on my brain

Just your neck
Just your eyes
Just your desire
Just your love
And my soul

Just your love
Just your shadow
Just your voice
And my soul

Just your love
Just your shadow
Just your voice
And my soul

I don't wanna know the way down
