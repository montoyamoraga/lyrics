# Say Something Loving

Before it slips away

Say something loving
I just don't remember the thrill of affection
I just don't remember

Say something loving
I need a reminder the feeling's escaped me

I went looking for it
Could have been anyone's kiss
Throwing my arms at no one
When I gave up I found love

The thought flows through my mind
And it's growing all the time
I do myself a disservice
To feel this weak to be this nervous

You say something loving
It's so overwhelming the thrill of affection
Feels so unfamiliar

You say something loving
Without hesitation it hits me hits me
It feels so unfamiliar

Before it slips away

Your touch stays on my skin
I feel it start sinking in
Here come my insecurities
I almost expect you to leave

Were you really looking for me
Try your best to reassure me
I wasn't patient to meet you
Am I too needy am I too eager

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

What this is
But it doesn't feel wrong

I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

What this is
But it doesn't feel wrong

Did you hear me say it
Say it
Did you hear me say

I say something loving
I can't hold it inside the thrill of affection
Is only getting stronger

I say something loving
All my hesitations are fading fading
I feel it taking over

Before it slips away
Don't let it slip away

Before it slips away
Don't let it slip away
