# Test Me  

I don't know where I went wrong  
Tell me should I see someone  
Ceiling's falling down on me  
You look but you never see  

Just take it out on me  
It's easier than saying what you mean  
Test me see if I break  
Tell me this time you've changed  
I'll take it out on you  
It's easier than talking it through  
Test me see if I stay  
How could I walk the other way
