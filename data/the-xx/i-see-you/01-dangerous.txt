# Dangerous

They say we're in danger
But I disagree
If proven wrong
Shame on me
But you've had faith in me

So I won't shy away
Should it all fall down
You'll have been my favorite mistake

They say
You are dangerous
But I don't care
I'm going to pretend that I'm not scared

If this only ends in tears
Then I won't say goodbye

Cause I couldn't care less
If they call us reckless
Until they are breathless
They must be blind

There are voices ringing over
They keep saying
Danger danger

I can't make them take you under
Makes no difference
No one can take this away
Should it all fall down
I'll treasure each day

They say
You are dangerous but I don't care
I'm going to pretend that I'm not scared
If this only ends in tears
Then I won't say goodbye
Cause I couldn't

Cause I couldn't care less
If they call us reckless
Until they are breathless
They must be blind

Let them say there are warning signs
They must be blind
They must be blind
They say

If this only ends in tears
Then I won't say goodbye
