# Replica  


Same right  
Same wrong  
Only difference is that   
I'm the one  

Second time  
Around  
Feels like the song's already  
Been sung  

Mirroring situations  
Accurate imitation  
Do I watch and repeat  

And as if I tried to  
I turned out just like you  
Do we watch and repeat  

They all say  
I will become a replica  
Your mistakes  
Were only chemical  

Twenty-five and you're just like me  
Is it in our nature
To be stuck on repeat  

Another encore to an after show  
Do I chase the night  
Or does the night chase me  

Mirroring situations  
Accurate imitation  
Do I watch and repeat  

And as if I tried to  
I turned out just like you  
Do we watch and repeat  

They all say  
I will become a replica  
Your mistakes  
Were only chemical  

Do I chase the night  
Or does the night chase me  

Do I chase the night  
Or does the night chase me  

They all say  
I will become a replica  
Your mistakes  
Were only chemical
