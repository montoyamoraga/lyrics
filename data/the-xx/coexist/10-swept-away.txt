# Swept Away

I get swept away
When I think of you
Take me to that place
Where it's control I lose

I'm soothed by you
You take it all away
I lose to you
Surrendered at the start of the game

I'll never deceive
Right here I'll always be

Hide away
I hide away with you
I let the world just slip away
I'm left with you

You light up the sky
And shadow the moon
The moments we've shared
Always ended too soon

Part of you stays a while
Even when you're far away
How so far away yet you feel so near
