# Angels  

Light reflects from your  
Shadow it is  
More than I  
Thought could exist  

You move through the room  
Like breathing was easy  
If someone believed me  

The would be as in love with you as I am  
The would be as in love with you as I am  
The would be as in love with you as I am  
The would be in  
Love love love  

And everyday  
I am learning about you  
The things that no one else sees  

And the end comes too soon  
Like dreaming of angels  

And leaving without them  
And leaving without them  

Being as in love with you as I am  
Being as in love with you as I am  
Being as in love with you as I am  
Being as in  
Love love love  
Love love love  
Love love love  

And with words unspoken  
A silent devotion  
I know you know what I mean  
And the end is unknown  
But I think I'm ready  
As long as you're with me  

Being as in love with you as I am  
Being as in love with you as I am  
Being as in love with you as I am  
Being as in  
Love love love
