# Missing

My heart is beating
In a different way
Been gone such a long time
I don't feel the same

My heart is beating
In a different way
Been gone such a long time

Will you miss me
How did I
How did I
How did I oh

When there's nothing to see
How did I
How did I
How did I oh

Tell me how did this come to be
How did I
How did I
How did I oh

And now there's no hope for you and me

My heart is beating
In a different way
Been gone such a long time
I don't feel the same

My heart is beating
In a different way
Been gone such a long time

Do you still believe
Ah
Ah
Ah
Oh

In you and me
Ah
Ah
Ah
Oh

Are we all we could be
Ah
Ah
Ah
Oh

Is it meant to be

My heart is beating
In a different way
Been gone such a long time
I don't feel the same

My heart is beating
In a different way
Been gone such a long time

My heart is beating
In a different way
Been gone such a long time
