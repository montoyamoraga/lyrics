# Sunset  

I saw you again  
It felt like we had never met  
It's like the sun set in your eyes  
And never wanted to rise  

And what have you done  
With the one I love  
When I look into your eyes  
I see no surprise  

I always thought it was sad  
The way we act like strangers  
After all that we had  
We act like we had never met  

We make believe  
I've never seen your face  
You neither me  
You catch my eye  
I'll register a smile  

You were more than just a friend  
Oh the feeling  
It never came to an ending  
I can't bear to see you  

I always thought it was a shame  
That we have to play these games  
It felt like you really knew me  
Now it feels like you see through me  

When I see you again  
I'll know not to expect  
Stay one step away  
We won't have to wait  

When I see you again  
And I'm greeted as a friend  
It is understood  
That we did all we could  

I always thought it was sad  
The way we act like strangers  
After all that we had  
We act like we had never met  

I always thought it was a shame  
That we have to play these games  
It felt like you really knew me  
Now it feels like you see through me
