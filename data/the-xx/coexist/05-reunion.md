# Reunion  

We visit a life we both left behind  
We know the heart  
Move to the ever moving  
Or blazing we go over  
And over and over and over again  

If I wait too long  
I lose you from my sight  
Maybe tonight  
I could stop dreaming  
And start believing in forever  
And ever and ever and ever again  

Reunion reunion  
Reunion reunion  
Never not ever  
Never not ever again  

And it's burning inside until you give it up  
How long should I wait  
There's no need to hide unless  
Only you in here  

There's and end to us with someone else inside  
You shine your light  
There goes that feeling  
Won't let me see them  
Never not ever  
Never not ever again  

Did I  
See you  
See me  
In a new light  

Did I  
See you  
See me  
In a new light  

Did I  
See you  
See me  
In a new light  

Never not ever again  

Did I  
Never not ever  
See you  
Never again  

See me  
Never not ever  
In a new light  
Never not ever again  

Did I  
See you  
See me  
Never not ever  
Never not ever again
