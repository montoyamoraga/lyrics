# VCR

You
You used to have all the answers

And you
You still have them to

And we
We live half in the day time

And we
We live half at night

Watch things on VCRs
With me and talk about big love
I think we're superstars
You say you think we are the best thing

But you
You just know
You just do

Wanna find myself by the sea
In another's company by the sea

When I go out to the pier
Gonna dive and have no fear

Because you
You just know
You just do

Watch things on VCRs
With me and talk about big love
I think we're superstars
You say you think we are the best thing

But you
You just know
You just do
