# Basic Space  

Neck chest waist to floor  
Easy to take you could take me in fours  
Make me a deal a day a piece  
Take it all just stay a week  

I'll take you in pieces we can take all apart  
I've suffered shipwrecks right from the start  
I've been underwater breathing out and in  
I think I'm losing where you end and I begin  

Basic space  
Open air  
Don't look away  
When there's nothing there  

I'm setting us in stone  
Piece by piece before I'm alone  
Air tight before we break  
Keep it in keep us safe  

It's a pool of boiling wax I'm getting in  
Let it set got to seal this in  
Can't adjust can't relearn  
Got to keep what I have preserve  

Basic space  
Open air  
Don't look away  
When there's nothing there  

Hot wax has left me with a shine  
Wouldn't know if I'd been left behind  
Second skin  
Second skin  

I can't let it out  
I still let you in  
I can't let it out  
I still let you in
