# Heart Skipped A Beat  

Please don't say we're done when I'm not finished  
Cause I could give so much more  
Make you feel like never before  
Welcome they said welcome to the floor  

It's been a while and you've found someone better  
But I've been waiting too long to give this up  
The more I see I understand  
But sometimes I still need you  

Sometimes I still need you  
Sometimes I still need you  
Sometimes I still need you  
Sometimes I still need you  

Sometimes I still need you  
Sometimes I still need you  
Sometimes I still need you  
Sometimes I still need you  

Ant I was struggling to get in  
Left waiting outside your door  
I was sure  
You'd give me more  

No need to come to me  
When I can make it all the way to you  
You made it clear you weren't near  
Near enough for me  

Heart skipped a beat  
And when I caught it you were out of reach  
But I'm sure I'm sure  
You've heard it before  

Heart skipped a beat  
And when I caught it you were out of reach  
But I'm sure I'm sure  
You've heard it before  

Heart skipped a beat  
And when I caught it you were out of reach  
But I'm sure I'm sure  
You've heard it before  

Heart skipped a beat  
And when I caught it you were out of reach  
But I'm sure I'm sure  
You've heard it before
