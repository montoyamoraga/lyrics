# Stars

I can give it all on the first date
I don't have to exist outside this place
And dear know that I can change

But if stars shouldn't shine
By the very first time
Then dear it's fine
So fine by me
Cause we can give it time
So much time
With me

And I can draw the line on the first date
I'll let you cross it
Let you take every line I've got
When the time gets late

But if stars shouldn't shine
By the very first time
Then dear it's fine
So fine by me
Cause we can give it time
So much time
With me

If you want me
Let me know
Where do you wanna go
No need for talking
I already know
If you want me
Why I go
If you want me
Let me know
Where do you wanna go
No need for talking
I already know
If you want me
Why go

I can give it all on the first date
I don't have to exist outside this place
And dear know that I can change

But if stars shouldn't shine
By the very first time
Then dear it's fine
So fine by me
Cause we can give it time
So much time
With me

But if stars shouldn't shine
By the very first time
Then dear it's fine
So fine by me
Cause we can give it time
So much time
With me
