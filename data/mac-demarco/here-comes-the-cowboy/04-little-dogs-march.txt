# Little Dogs March

Hope you had your fun
All those days are over now
The sunset's at the skyline
Say goodnight and kindly take your bow

March on
Little doggy
March on
Little dog

Hope you got your fill
All those days are over now
The river's all dammed up
So fill your cup and kindly take your bow

And march on
Little doggy
March on
Little dog

March on
Little doggy
March on
Little dog
