# Preoccupied

Passin' around
You blacken your body
No conversation
To ease up your mind
And nobody seems
To see the outside of it

Preoccupied
And nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied
Nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied
Nobody's hiding it

Opened your mind
Filled it with bullshit
Locked up your heart
Without even knowing it
It must be a sign
The days that we're living in

Preoccupied
And nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied
And nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied
Nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied yeah
And nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied
And nobody's hiding it
