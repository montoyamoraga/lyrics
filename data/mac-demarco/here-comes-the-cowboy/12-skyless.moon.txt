# Skyless Moon

Baby blue
I know how things have changed for you
Remember that the days are numbered
Springtime turns to summer
With or without you

Little man
The autumn came and changed up your plans
Remember now their dead had gone
No one wants you singing along

More and more and more and more
More and more and more and more and more

Baby blue
I've been making changes too
Remember now the time's been spent up
There's no place left to rent out
There ain't much else for you to do

Skyless moon
Maybe spring will change up your tune
Remember now its dead had gone
Memories keep singing their songs

More and more and more and more and more
More and more and more and more and more
More and more and more and more and more
More and more and more and more and more
