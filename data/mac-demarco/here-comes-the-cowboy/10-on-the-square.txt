# On The Square

Brother's hands
This time it's in brother's hands

Baby are you satisfied?
Is this all that you had in mind?

On the square
Live a life that isn't there
Square it up
Call me once you've had enough

Brother's hands
Feel the grip of brother's hands
Maybe it's been rectified
Locked outside and left to die

On the square
Live a life that isn't there
Square it up
Call me once you've had enough

On the square
Live a life that isn't there
Square it up
Call me once you've had enough
