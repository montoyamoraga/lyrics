# Heart To Heart

To all the days we were together
To all the time we were apart
Of each other's lives
Heart to heart

And so I had a late arrival
So we never saw the start
Of each other's lives
Heart to heart

Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart

And though it seems so quick and easy
Sentimentally assumed
Walking parallels
Heart to heart

To all the days we were together
To all the time we played apart
In each other's lives
Heart to heart

Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart

Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
Heart to heart
