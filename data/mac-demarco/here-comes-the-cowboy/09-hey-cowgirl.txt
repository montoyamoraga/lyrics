# Hey Cowgirl

Hey cowgirl

Hey cowgirl
Will you stay on the farm
Or will you come on back with me

Hey cowgirl
Give up all of your stars
To watch some TV

Hey cowgirl
What's it gonna be

Hey cowgirl
Try the big city lights
For a little while

Hey cowgirl
Sure as hell ain't no stars
Down the dairy aisle

Hey cowgirl
What's it gonna be

Hey cowgirl
What's it gonna be
