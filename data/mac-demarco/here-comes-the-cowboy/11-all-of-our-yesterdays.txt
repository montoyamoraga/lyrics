# All Of Our Yesterdays

Holdin' out
Another day has come and let you down
All of our yesterdays have gone now
Tearin' up
Lookin' for a shoulder to prop you up

All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone

And that don't mean your dream is over
And that don't make your heart beat slower
Such a shame to complain
When all of our yesterdays have gone away

Holdin' on
An image of a memory another song
All of our yesterdays have gone now
Call me up
When you need a shoulder to prop you up

All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone

And that don't mean your dream is over
And that don't make your heart beat slower
Such a shame to complain
When all of our yesterdays have gone away
And that don't mean your dream is over
And that don't make your heart beat slower
Such a shame to complain
When all of our yesterdays have gone away
