# Finally Alone

Sick of the city
Locked in with all the pretty people
You need a vacation
Somewhere that no one ever would dream to go

Somewhere mundane
Hop on the train
See where it goes

Finish your ride
Hop off and hide
Now that you're finally alone

Oh yeah yeah
Honey you're finally alone
Oh yeah yeah ho

Out in the country
Tending to all the pretty cattle
It turns out the cowboy dreams of the city
Who could have ever known

Hop on a plane
Fly out to Spain
Int√©ntalo yeah

Pick up your bags
Cure your jet lag
Now that you're finally alone

Oh yeah yeah
Honey you're finally alone
Oh yeah yeah
Honey you're finally alone
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
Honey you're finally alone
Oh yeah yeah ho
