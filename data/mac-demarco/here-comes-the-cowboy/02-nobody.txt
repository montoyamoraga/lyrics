# Nobody

I'm the preacher
A done decision
Another creature
Who's lost its vision

Let it go
Reel it in
For the creature
On television

There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree

I'm a fixture
A split decision
A pretty picture
A superstition

Let it go
Cash it in
For the creature
On television

There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree

There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree
