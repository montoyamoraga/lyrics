# K

As the years blow by baby
The more I come to know myself
The more it seems my love grows for you

And surely I'd be dead baby
Had I gone with someone else
For this and more my love sold to you

K anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
K settle down turn around and take this song and let it play

Got to know your heart baby
Still so much for me to learn
And as I do my love stays with you

And surely I'd be done baby
Had I made another turn
Glad the turn that I made was you

K anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
K settle down turn around and take this song and let it play

K anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
K settle down turn around and take this song and let it play
