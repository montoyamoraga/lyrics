# Moonlight on the River

I'd say
See you later
If I thought I'd see you later

And I'd tell you
That I loved you
If I did

It's so strange
Deciding
How to feel about it

It's such a strange
Emotion
Standing there beside it

I'm home
With moonlight on the river
Saying my goodbyes

I'm home
There's moonlight on the river
Everybody dies

I'd say
See you next time
If I thought there were a next time

Easy
Conversation
Ain't exactly where we're at

It's so strange
Deciding
How I feel about you

It ain't like
I ain't used
To going on without you

I'm home
With moonlight on the river
Saying my goodbyes

I'm home
There's moonlight on the river
Everybody dies

I'm home
With moonlight on the river
Saying my goodbyes

I'm home
There's moonlight on the river
Everybody dies
