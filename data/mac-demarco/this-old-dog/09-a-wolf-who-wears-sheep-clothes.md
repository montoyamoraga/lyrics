# A Wolf Who Wears Sheeps Clothes  

Just trying to keep it light  
Sometimes casts a shadow  
Trouble is keeping quiet  
And you know well where your heart goes  

Troubles with meeting anybody  
These days are bringing you down  
All predisposed to believe in  
In a wolf who wears sheep clothes  

Yeah  

Don't let the world outside the window  
Pane get to your head  
Hopefully make some sense of all this shit  
Before you're dead  

The troubles with meeting anybody   
Follow wherever you go  
All predisposed to believe in  
In a wolf who wears sheep clothes  

Yeah
