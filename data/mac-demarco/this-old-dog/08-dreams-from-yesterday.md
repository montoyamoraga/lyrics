# Dreams from Yesterday  

Once your dreams  
Come knocking at your door  
It's time to realize  
You aren't dreaming anymore  

And once your life  
Is set to settle down  
Take a look around you  
No more dreaming to be found  

So why then
Are you crying  
It was you  
Who denied them  

And no amount of tears  
Could roll back all the years  
Bring back all your dreams  
From yesterday  

Once a life  
Believes it's got it set up  
A closer look reveals  
Just how empty you can feel  

Once a dream  
Is finally put to bed  
Rest up sleepy head  
You might as well be dead  

So why then  
Are you crying  
It was you  
Who denied them  

And no amount of tears  
Could roll back all the years  
Bring back all your dreams  
From yesterday
