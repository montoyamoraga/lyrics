# My Old Man

Look in the mirror
Who do you see
Someone familiar
But surely not me

For he can't be me
Look how old and cold and tired
And lonely he's become

Not until you see
There's a price tag hanging off of having
All that fun

Uh oh looks like
I'm seeing more of my old man in me

Oh no looks like
I'm seeing more of my old man in me

Walk on the outside
Holding her hand
Someone familiar
Her and her man

But it just can't be
Look at all the steps that brought you where
You are today

Not until you see
As a heart grows stronger sometimes love
Is pushed away

Uh oh looks like
I'm seeing more of my old man in me

Oh no looks like
I'm seeing more of my old man in me

Uh oh looks like
I'm seeing more of my old man in me

Oh no looks like
I'm seeing more of my old man in me
