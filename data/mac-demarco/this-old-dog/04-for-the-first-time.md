# For the First Time  

While she's been away  
Living day to day has been tough  
Without her at my side  
Simply being alive it's been rough  

Know she won't be gone forever  
There are many times I find it feels that way  
And I'm not trying to forget her  
Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day  

It's just like seeing her  
For the first time  
Again  

It's just like seeing her  
For the first time  
Again  

The time she's not around  
Somewhere out of town it's been hard  
But somehow this old heart
Found time to work it out this far

No I know she's coming home soon  
There are times I find it hard to feel that way  
It's not inside me to forget her  
Just understand how I'll be feeling on that day  

It's just like seeing her  
For the first time  
Again  

It's just like seeing her  
For the first time  
Again  

It's just like seeing her  
For the first time  
Again  

It's just like seeing her  
For the first time  
Again
