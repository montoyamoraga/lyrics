# On the Level

Boy
This could be your year
Make an old man proud of you
Forget about the tears

On the level
See me eye to eye
Stand up like a man
Even from the other side

On the level
On the level

Man
I never had a choice
Never had a chance
Never had a voice

On the level
Carrying a name
Fall until my final day
Now who's there left to blame

On the level
On the level
