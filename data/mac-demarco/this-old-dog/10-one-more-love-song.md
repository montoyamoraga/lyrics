# One More Love Song

Another turn
Another shift
One last kiss from her lips

Another dream
You're putting down
After all this time
It turns out all you found

Is one more love
Out to break your heart
Set it up
Just to watch it fall apart

Another try
Another go
Never thought you'd feel this low

Another dream
Put to bed
After all this time
It turns out all you had

Is one more love
Out to break your heart
Set it up
Just to watch it fall apart

One more love
Out to break your heart
Set it up
Just to watch it fall apart
