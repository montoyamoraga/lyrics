# One Another  

Hey kid
Everybody's prone to some mistakes  
If you'd always kept it straight you'd never learn  
You'd run the risk of all the risks you take  

Don't feel  
Like all the time you put in went to waste  
The way your heart was beating all those days  
And suddenly it beats another pace  

It's not like you never tried to forget her  
But these days are better without one another  

Hey man  
So now you've got it off your chest  
Your heart can finally get some rest  
Same heart that started this wole mess  

And although  
A broken heart needs time to mend  
Yours wasn't ever really broken was it  
You lose a love you gain a friend  

It's not like you never tried to forget her  
But these days are better without one another  

Without one another  
Without one another  
Without one another
