# Still Beating

I never meant to make her cry
And now I'm seeing tears in her eyes

Half and half make believe
Cause so she thought well my heart was on my sleeve

Honey I cried too
You better believe it

Honey my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it beating

Never thought some silly songs
Could ever go and hurt someone

I never meant to sing my tune
For anybody else out there but you

Honey I cried too
You better believe it

Honey my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it

Honey I cried too
You better believe it

Honey my heart still beats for you
Even though you don't feel it beating
