# Robson Girl

Maybe when we're older
We can try this over
Lovin' on the sidelines
Another one of my kind

Robson girl
Sit down by your daddy

Robson girl
Sit down by your daddy

No one else's shoulder
I felt could be colder
Lovin' on the sidelines
Just one street on my mind

Robson girl
Sit down by your daddy

Robson girl
Sit down by your daddy

Robson girl
Sit down by your daddy

Robson girl
Sit down by your daddy
