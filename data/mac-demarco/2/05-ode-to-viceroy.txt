# Ode to Viceroy

Viceroy
Early in the morning
Just trying to let the sun in
And open up my eyes

Viceroy
As it's getting later
Heading for the corner
Already running dry

And oh don't let me see you crying
Cause oh honey I'll smoke you 'til I'm dying

Viceroy
Don't take me for a fool now
I'm only trying to calm down
Just trying to keep it cool

Viceroy
As it's getting later
Heading for the corner
I'm leaving it to you

And oh don't let me see you crying
Cause oh honey I'll smoke you 'til I'm dying

There really is nothing quite like it
