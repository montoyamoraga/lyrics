# Sherrill  

Getting hard to remember  
Getting hard to recall  
Getting laid off and pushed out  
And it ain't my baby's fault  

So if you go  
Don't cry  
I'll be right there  
At your side  

Sherrill  
Sherrill  

Getting laid on the lifeline  
Getting tired time for bed  
And there's no use getting worked up  
I'll remember all you said  

And if you go  
Don't cry  
I'll be right there  
At your side
