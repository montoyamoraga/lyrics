# Freaking Out the Neighborhood

Sorry mama
There are times I get carried away

Please don't worry
Next time I'm home I'll still be the same

And I know it's no fun
When your first son
Gets up to no good
Starts freaking out the neighborhood

Really I'm fine
Never been better got no job on the line

Sincerely don't worry
Same old boy that you hoped you would find

And I know it's no fun
When your first son
Gets up to no good
Starts freaking out the neighborhood
