# European Vegas

So you think you're lonely
You think that you're the only one
Baby listen closely
Don't let me be another one

The city's getting colder
The streets are turning into ice
So baby hold me closer
And let me stay for one more night

Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas

So baby take my hand
Walking down the avenue
I know you wanted Paris
I guess that this'll have to do

So come on quit your dreaming
Girl I got the master plan
City isn't so bad
When you're with your lover man

Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas

Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
