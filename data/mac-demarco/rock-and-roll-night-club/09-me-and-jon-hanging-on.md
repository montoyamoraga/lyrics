# Me and Jon Hanging On  

Sweetheart  
Wipe those tears away  
And let me love you baby  

Oh darling  
Come out of your cave  
And let me love you baby  

It's just me and Jon  
We're hanging on  
Trying it out  
Singing our song  
It's just Jon and me  
And all that we've seen  
Trying it out  
Plain as can be  

Sweetheart  
Wipe those tears away  
And let me love you baby  

Oh darling  
Come out of your cave  
And let me love you baby  

It's just me and Jon  
We're hanging on  
Trying it out  
Singing our song  
It's just Jon and me  
And all that we've seen  
Trying it out  
Plain as can be
