# She's Really All I Need  

Up out of bed at three  
And I feel like I'm dying  
But if she's there next to me  
Then there's no use in crying  

Cause she's really all I need  
It's true my heart is flying  
Life can be such a breeze  
As long as it's just her and me  

Don't bring me down man  
Wearing that frown man now  
It's tryouts for my brain  
Step into my frame now  

I smell your arts degree  
It's telling me I'm lazy  
I'm working so I can eat  
So keep that shit away from me  

Cause she's really all I need  
And up until I'm dying  
Life will be such a breeze  
As long as it's just her and me  

Don't bring me down man  
Wearing that frown man now  
It's tryouts for my brain  
Step into my frame now  

Don't bring me down man  
Wearing that frown man now  
It's tryouts for my brain  
Step into my frame now  

Don't bring me down man  
Wearing that frown man now  
It's tryouts for my brain  
Step into my frame now
