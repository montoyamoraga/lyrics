# Baby's Wearing Blue Jeans

Standing on the corner
Trying to keep it clean
A fine looking woman
In a pair of Lee's
Take her back to my place
Lay her down in bed
Now she starts to strip down
I say leave 'em on instead

Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans

Later in the evening
Dipping in the tub
Washing wearing Wranglers
I think that I'm in love
Straight leg or bootcut
Legging darling please
Stay with me forever
Don't take off those jeans

Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans

Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans

Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
