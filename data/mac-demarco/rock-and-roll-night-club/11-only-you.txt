# Only You

Only you
Only you
Only you
Can treat me like you do

And only she
Only she
Only she
Chose me when I'm blue
So sorry boo we're through

Cause I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
My hands hurt I think I'll go lay down
Cause I'm done crying over her

Here I am
Brand new day
Now this you
Let me show you boo

That only she
Only she
Only she
Chose me when I'm green
So sorry boo we're through

Cause I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
I'm done crying over her
My hands hurt I think I'll go lay down

Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
Lay down
