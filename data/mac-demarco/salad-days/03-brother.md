# Brother  

Shit  

You're no better off  
Living your life  
Than dreaming at night  

This much is true  
But it's still up to you  
To take my advice  

To take it slowly brother  
Let it go now brother  
Take it slowly brother  
Let it go  

Go home
Go home  

Go home  
Go home  

You're better off dead  
When your mind's been set  
From nine until five  

How could it be true  
Well i'ts happened to you  
So take my advice  

And take it slowly brother  
Let it go now brother  
Take it slowly brother  
Let it go  

Go home
Go home  

Go home  
Go home  

Go home  
Go home  

Go home  
Go home
