# Salad Days

As I'm getting older
Chip up on my shoulder
Rolling through life
To roll over and die

Missing Hippie Jon
Salad days are gone
Remembering things
Just to tell 'em so long

Oh mama
Actin' like my life's already over
Oh dear
Act your age and try another year

Always feeling tired
Smiling when required
Write another year off
And kindly resign

Salad days are gone
Missing Hippie Jon
Remember the days
Just to tell 'em so long

Oh mama
Actin' like my life's already over
Oh dear
Act your age and try another year

Oh mama
Actin' like my life's already over
Oh dear
Act your age and try another year
