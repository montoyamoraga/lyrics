# Go Easy

Pack it up and leave it
Leave it all behind you
Starting fresh in someone else's town

And though we may be leaving
I'll be right beside you
To pick you up until you come around

So please
Go easy with my baby
Please
Go easy

Please
Go easy with my baby
Please
Go easy

Honey it can be though
Without your friends beside you
You built up just to knock it down

So when you're feeling rough
I'll be right behind you
To pick you up until you come around

So please
Go easy with my baby
Please
Go easy

Please
Go easy with my baby
Please
Go easy

So please
Go easy with my baby
Please
Go easy

Please
Go easy with my baby
Please
Go easy

So please
Go easy with my baby
Please
Go easy

Please
Go easy with my baby
Please
Go easy
