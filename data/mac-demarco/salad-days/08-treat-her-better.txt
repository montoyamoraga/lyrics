# Treat Her Better

Hey man
Heard you were your brother's keeper
That can't be
Judging by the way you treat her

Oh no
You've done it again
No use
When you already know how it ends

Treat her better boy
If having her at your side's something you enjoy
If having her in your life's really so important to you now

Hey man
Who's been keeping brother?
Hey man
How old is your mother?

Oh no
You've done it again
No use
When you already know how it ends

Treat her better boy
If having her at your side's something you enjoy
If having her in your life's really so important to you now

Treat her better boy
If having her at your side's something you enjoy
If having her in your life's really so important to you now

Treat her better boy
If having her at your side's something you enjoy
If having her in your life's really so important to you now

Treat her better boy
If having her at your side's something you enjoy
If having her in your life's really so important to you now
