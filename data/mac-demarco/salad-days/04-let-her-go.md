# Let Her Go  

Tell her that you love her  
If you really love her  
But if your heart just ain't sure  
Let her know  

Growing by the hour  
Love just like a flower  
But when the flower dies  
You've got to say goodbye  
Let her go  

Let her go  
Let her go  

Tell her that you'll be there  
If you'll really be there  
Separation's supposed to  
Make the heart grow fond  
But it don't  

So tell her that you love her  
If you really love her  
But if your heart just ain't sure  
Let her go  

Let her go  
Let her go  

Let her go  
Let her go  

Yeah

Or you can keep her  
It's okay  
It's up to you  
Make your own choice  
Whatever you gotta do  
God bless
