# Passing Out Pieces

Watching my life
Passing right in front of my eyes
Hell of a story
Or is it boring?

Can't claim to care
Never been reluctant to share
Passing out pieces of me
Don't you know nothing comes free?

What mom don't know has taken its toll on me
It's all I've seen that can't be wiped clean
It's hard to believe what it's made of me

Passing my life
Living it out with her side
Listening closely
Hearing her mostly

Can't shake concern
Seems that every time that I turn
I'm passing out pieces of me
Don't you know nothing comes free?

What mom don't know has taken its toll on me
It's all I've seen that can't be wiped clean
It's hard to believe what it's made of me
