# Let My Baby Stay  

I was made to love her  
Been working at it  
Half of my life  
I've been an addict  

And she's been good to me  
Far as I can tell she's happy  
Living with her Macky  

So please don't take  
My love away  
Let my baby stay  
Let my baby stay  

Please don't take  
My love away  
Let my baby stay  
Let my baby stay  

And where would I be  
Feeling lonely  
Separated  
From my one and only  

And what's there left to say  
Far as I can tell that day  
Could be on its way  

So please don't take  
My love away  
Let my baby stay  
Let my baby stay  

Please don't take  
My love away  
Let my baby stay  
Let my baby stay
