# No Other Heart

Is it true
You've been feeling sort of low these days
Just don't have a place to go these days
Must be bringing you down

If it's so
Then come on give this lover boy a try
I'll put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose

Well for one
Her heart
Belongs to another

And no other
Heart
Will do

Is it wrong
To think my love could really help you out
It's simply just my stubborn heart no doubt
Rambling away

If it's so
Then come on give this lover boy a try
I'll put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose

Well for one
Her heart
Belongs to another

And no other
Heart
Will do

Well for one
Her heart
Belongs to another

And no other
Heart
Will do
