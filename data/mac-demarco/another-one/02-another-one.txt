# Another One

Feeling so confused
You don't know what to do
Afraid she might not love you anymore

And though she says she does
And hasn't lost your trust
Who could that be knocking at her door

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves

The feeling never stops
And neither does the clock
Wishing for tomorrow today

She still says she's true
So you start coming to
Just as that old knocking comes to stay

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves

Must be another one
Must be another one she loves
