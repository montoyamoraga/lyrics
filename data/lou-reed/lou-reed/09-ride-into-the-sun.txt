# Ride Into The Sun

Looking for another chance
For someone else to be
Looking for another place
To ride into the sun

Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun

Where everything seems so pretty
But if you're tired and you're sick of the city
Remember that it's just a flower
Made out of clay
Oh oh oh the city

Where everything seems so dirty
But if you're tired and you're filled with self pity
Remember that you're just one more
Person who's there

It's hard to live in the city
It's hard to live in the city
It's hard to live in the city
It's hard to live in the city
