# I Can't Stand It

It's hard being a man
Living in a garbage pail
My landlady called me up
She tried to hit me with a mop

I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more

But if Candy would just come back
It'd be all right

Yeah if Candy would just come back
It would be all right
Come on baby

I live with thirteen dead cats
A purple dog that wears spats
They're all out living in the hall
And I can't stand it anymore

I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more

But if Candy would just come back
It'd be all right

Ooh if Candy would just come back
It would be all right
Be all right now

Oh come on baby

I'm tired of living all alone
Yeah nobody ever calls me on the phone
But when things start getting bad
I just play my music louder

I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more

I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it

I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it

I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it

I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
