# Walk And Talk It

I got hearts ah in my looney tunes
I got dreams and you do too
I got ten wheel drive
To pick you up up to your ears oh

I got refined carbon in my eyelids dear
I've got no one to love and no one to fear

You better walk it
And talk it less you lose that beat
You better lose yourself mama
And knock yourself right off your feet

If you're moving too fast
Don't you want it to last
You better walk it talk it
You better walk as you talk it less you lose that beat

I've got dimes in my shoes real nice
I've got bells that are laid on ice
I got dreams
Let me mix it with a little gin

I got cool when I'm cold and warm when I'm hot
But me is the one thing baby you ain't got

You got to walk it
And talk it less you lose that beat
You better lose yourself mama
And knock yourself right off of your feet

Yeah if you're moving too fast
Now don't you want it to last
You better walk it talk it
You better walk it as you talk it less you lose that beat

You better walk it
And talk it less you lose that beat
You better lose yourself mama
And knock yourself right off of your feet

Yeah if your'e moving too fast
Now don't you want it to last
You better walk it talk it
You better walk as you talk it less you lose that beat
