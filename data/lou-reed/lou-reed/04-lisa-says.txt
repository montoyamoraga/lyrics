# Lisa Says

Lisa says on a night like this
It'd be so nice if you gave me a great big kiss
And Lisa says honey for just one little smile
I'll sing and play for you for the longest while

Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says
Oh no
Lisa says

Lisa says honey you must think
I'm some kind of California fool
The way you treat me just like some kind of tool
Lisa says hey baby if you stick your tongue in my ear
Then the scene around here will become very clear

Lisa says
Oh no
Lisa says
Hey don't you be a little baby
Lisa says
Oh no
Lisa says

Hey if you're looking for a good time Charlie
Well that's not really what I am
You know some good time Charlie
Always out having this fun

But if you're looking for some good good loving
Then sit yourself right over here
You know that those good those good times
They just seem to pass me by just like pie in the sky

And Lisa says on a night like this
It'd be so nice if you gave me a great big kiss
And Lisa says hey baby for just one little smile
I'll sing and play for you for the longest while
Let me hear you now

Lisa says
Oh no no
Lisa says
Hey don't you be a little baby
Lisa says
Oh no
Lisa says

Why am I so shy
Why am I so shy
Gee you know those
Good good times they just seem to pass me by
Why am I so shys

First time I saw you I was talking to myself
I said hey you got such pretty pretty eyes
That pretty eyes

Now that you're next to me I just get so upset
And Lisa will you tell me why am I so shy

Why am I so shy
Why am I so shy
Well you know that those
Good good times they just seem to pass me by
Why am I so shy

And Lisa says on a night like this
It'd be so nice if you gave me a great big kiss
And Lisa says honey for just one little smile
I'll sing and play for you for the longest while

Lisa says
Oh no now
Lisa says
Hey don't you be a little baby
Lisa says
Oh no
Lisa says
