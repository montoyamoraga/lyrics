# Wagon Wheel

Won't you be my wagon wheel
Won't you tell me baby how do you feel

Yeah you got to live yeah your life
As though you're number one
Yeah you got to live yeah your life
And make a point of having some fun

But if you think
That you get kicks from flirting with danger
Danger ooh
Just kick her in the head and rearrange her

Oh heavenly father what can I do
What she's done to me is making me crazy
Oh heavenly father I know I have sinned
But look where I've been it's making me lazy

Won't you be my wagon wheel
Won't you tell me baby how does it feel

You got to live yeah your life
As though you're number one
Yeah you got to live yeah your life
And make a point of having some fun

But if you think
That you get kicks from flirting with danger
Danger ooh
Just kick her in the head and rearrange her

And then why don't you wake me shake me
Please don't you let me sleep too long
Why don't you wake me shake me
Please don't you let me sleep too long

Don't wanna miss it now wake me shake me baby
Please don't you let me sleep too long
I wanna know why don't you wake me shake me
Please don't you let me sleep too long

Why don't you wake me shake me
Please don't you let me sleep too long
Why why don't you wake me shake me
Please don't you let me sleep too long

Why don't you wake me shake me
Please don't you let me sleep too long
Why why don't you wake me shake me
Please don't you let me sleep too long
