# New York Telephone Conversation

I was sleeping gently napping
When I heard the phone
Who is on the other end talking
Am I even home

Did you see what she did to him
Did you hear what they said
Just a New York conversation
Rattling in my head

Oh oh my and what shall we wear
Oh oh my and who really cares

Just a New York conversation
Gossip all of the time
Did you hear who did what to whom
Happens all the time

Who has touched and who has dabbled
Here in the city of shows
Openings closing bad repartee
Everybody knows

Oh how sad and why do we call
Oh I'm glad to hear from you all

I am calling yes I am calling
Just to speak to you
For I know this night will kill me
If I can't be with you

If I can't be with you
