# Walk On The Wild Side

Holly came from Miami FLA
Hitchhiked her way across the USA
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Shaved her legs and then he was a she
She says hey baby talk a walk on the wild side
Said hey honey take a walk on the wild side

Candy came from out on the island
In the backroom she was everybody's darling
But she never lost her head
Even when she was giving head
She says hey babe talk a walk on the wild side
Said hey babe take a walk on the wild side
And the colored girls go

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Little Joe never once gave it away
Everybody had to pay and pay
A hustle here and a hustle there
New York City is the place where they said
Hey babe take a walk on the wild side
I said hey Joe take a walk on the wild side

Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
Looking for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the Apollo
You should have seen him go go go
They said hey sugar take a walk on the wild side
I said hey babe take a walk on the wild side alright

Jackie is just speeding aways
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Then I guess that she had to crash
Valium would have helped that dash
She said hey babe take a walk on the wild side
I said hey honey take a walk on the wild side
And the colored girls say

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
