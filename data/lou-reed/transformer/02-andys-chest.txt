# Andy's Chest

If I could be anything
In the world that flew
I would be a bat and come
Swooping after you
And if the last time you were here
Things where a bit askew

Well you know what happens after dark
When rattlesnakes lose their skins and their hearts
And all the missionaries lose their bark

Oh all the trees are calling after you
And all the venom snipers after you
Are all the mountains bolder after you

If I could be any one of the things
In this world that bite
Instead of a dentured ocelot on a leash
I'd rather be a kite
And be tied to the end of your string
And flying in the air baby at night

Cause you know what they say about honey bears
When you shave off all their baby hair
You have a hairy minded pink bare bear

And all the bells are rolling out for you
And stones are all erupting out for you
And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you

Yesterday Daisy Mae and Biff
Were grooving on the street
And just like in a movie
Her hands became her feet
Her belly button was her mouth
Which meant she tasted what she'd speak

But the funny thing is what happened to her nose
It grew until it reached all of her toes
Now when people say her feet smell they mean her nose

And curtains laced with diamonds dear for you
And all the roman noblemen for you
And kingdoms's christian soldiers dear for you
And melting ice cap mountains tops for you
Oh oh and knights in flaming silver robes for you
And bats that with a kiss turn prince for you
Swoop swoop oh baby rock rock
Swoop swoop rock rock
Swoop swoop rock rock
