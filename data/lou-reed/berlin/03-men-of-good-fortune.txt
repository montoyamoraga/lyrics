# Men Of Good Fortune

Men of good fortune
Often cause empires to fall
While men of poor beginnings
Often can't do anything at all

The rich son waits for his father to die
The poor just drink and cry
And me I just don't care at all

Men of good fortune
Very often can't do a thing
While men of poor beginnings
Often can do anything

At heart they try to act like a man
Handle things the best way they can
They have no rich daddy to fall back on

Men of good fortune
Often cause empires to fall
While men of poor beginnings
Often can't do anything at all

It takes money to make money they say
Look at the Fords but didn't they start that way
Anyway it makes no difference to me

Men of good fortune
Often wish that they could die
While men of poor beginnings
Want what they have and to get it they'll die

All those great things that life has to give
They wanna have money and live
But me I just don't care at all

Men of good fortune
Men of poor beginnings
Men of good fortune
Men of poor beginnings

Men of good fortune
Men of poor beginnings
Men of good fortune
Men of poor beginnings
