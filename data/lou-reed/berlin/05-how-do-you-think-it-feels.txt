# How Do You Think It Feels

How do you think it feels
When you're speeding and lonely
Come here baby
How do you think it feels
When all you can say is if only

If only I had a little
If only I had some change
Come here baby
If only if only if only

How do you think it feels
And when do you think it stops

How do you think it feels
When you've been up for five days
Come down here mama
Hunting around always ooh
Cause you're afraid of sleeping

How do you think it feels
To feel like a wolf and foxy
How do you think it feels
To always make love by proxy huh
How do you think it feels
And when do you think it stops
When do you think it stops
