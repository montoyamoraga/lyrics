# The Kids

They're taking her children aways
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because she was making it with sisters and brothers
And everyone else all of the others
Like cheap officers who would
Stand there and flirt in front of me

They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because of the things that they heard she had done
The black air force sergeant was not the first one
And all of the drugs she took if you want every one every one

And I am the water boy
The real game's not over here
But my heart is overflowing anyway
I'm just a tired man no words to say
But since she lost her daughter
It's her eyes that fill with water
And I am much happier this way

They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because number one was the girlfriend from Paris
The things that they did they didn't have to ask us
And then the Welsh man from India who came here to stay

They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because of the things she did in the streets
In the alleys and bars no she couldn't be beat
That miserable rotten slut couldn't turn anyone away

I am the water boy
The real game's not over here
But my heart is overflowing anyway
I'm just a tired man no words to say
But since she lost her daughter
It's her eyes that fill with water
And I am much happier this way
