# Under The Earth  

Down down under the earth goes another lover  

Down down under earth goes another lover  
Down down under earth goes another lover  

Twelve tongues put a hex on you  
Small mouths don't dare shout out  
No fun for a night out  
No fun for a night out on the town  

Twelve tongues put a hex on you  
Small mouths don't dare shout out  
No fun for a night out  
No fun for a night out on the town  

Run away run away  
Not a ghost or roach would stay  
On your own on your own  
You're not safe  

Gone away gone away  
Not a ghost or roach would stay  
On your own on your own  
You're not safe  

Down down under the earth goes another lover  

Down down under earth goes another lover  
Down down under earth goes another lover  

Milk for you what you're worth and call it murder  
Down down under earth goes another lover  


Twelve tongues put a hex on you
