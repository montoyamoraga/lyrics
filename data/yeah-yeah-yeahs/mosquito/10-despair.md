# Despair  

Don't despair  
You're there  
From beginning to middle to end  

Don't despair  
You're there through my wasted days  
You're there through my wasted nights  

Oh despair  
You've always been there  
You've always been there  
You've always been there  

You were there through my wasted years  
Through all my lonely fears
No tears run through my fingers tears  
They're stinging my eyes no tears  

If it's all in my head  
There's nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear inside  
Through the darkness and the light  
Some sun has got to rise  

My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  

Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  

My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  

Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  

Oh despair  
You're there through my wasted days  
You're there through my wasted nights  
You're there through my wasted years  
You're there through my wasted life  

You've always been there  
You've always been there  
You've always been there  

You were there through my wasted years  
Through all my lonely fears  
No tears run through my fingers tears  
They're stinging my eyes no tears  

We're all on the edge there's nothing to fear  
Nothing to fear inside  
Through the darkness and the light  
Some sun has got to rise  

My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  

Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  

Some sun has got to rise  

My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  
My sun is your sun  

Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  
Your sun is our sun  

Some sun has got to rise
