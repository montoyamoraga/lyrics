# Slave

It eats your soul
Like tears you fall my slave
You steal you heed
The call my slave

The keys the keys
Are gold my slave
You keep me
Beating on

It eats your soul
Like tears you fall my slave
You steal you heed
The call my slave

You keep me

On my own
You keep me keep me
On the throne
Heads down all obey

On my own
You keep me keep me
On the throne
Heads down all obey

Can I feed on your love
The keys are gold my slave

Can I feed on your love
You keep me beating on
