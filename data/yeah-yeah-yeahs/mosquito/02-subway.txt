# Subway

I lost you on the subway car
Got caught without my metro card
I waited and I waited for the express train
Wanna catch up with you wherever you are

I waited and I waited
I waited and I waited

I waited and I waited
I waited and I waited

And it was hot
And when it stopped

It was metal on the mental
It was something in my heart

It was metal on the mental
It was something in my heart
My heart

Got on the train and I took a seat
Thought why are these people all watching me
Caught my reflection in the subway car
Thought I'd look at you whoever you are

I waited and I waited
I waited and I waited

I waited and I waited
I waited and I waited

And it was cool
And when it stopped

It was metal on the mental
It was something in my heart

Metal on the mental
It was something in my heart

Well I got I got I got I got
Got off got off on you

Well I got I got I got
Got off got off got off on you

Well I got got got off I got
Got off got off got off on you

I got I got I got
Got off got off got off on you

It was metal on the mental
It was something in my heart

It was metal on the mental
It was something in my heart
