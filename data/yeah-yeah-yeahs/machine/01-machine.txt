Wasteful season
Take my hand
Take the place
Of the snakes who ran

Hey
Ha

Savage things
Wash over me
A crime that
Leaves the heated green

Oh machine
Machine
I washed it for you

Oh machine
Machine
I wasted for you

And I walk and I walk
The space left for two
And I wait and I wait
To wake next to you

And I walk and I walk
The space left for two
And I wait and I wait
To wake next to you

Oh machine
Machine
I wasted for you

Machine
Machine
I washed it for you

Machine
Machine
I washed it for you
