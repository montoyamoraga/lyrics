# Down Boy  

No fame all there is  
All there was on the second lady  

Can't take a cent take a cut  
Of that kind of ran  

I'll stand kind of pushed  
Kind of bent on this heavy land

I'll stand for the sake of my friend  
I will see him there  

Down  
Down  
Count me down  
Down  

Down boy down  
Count me down  
Down boy  
Down boy  

Down boy down  

The same not begin  
Not give up in a better way  

Again washed the stain off his bed  
Not to split him up  

I'll stand for the sake of my friend  
I will see him there  

Well I will see him there  

Down  
Down  
Count me down  
Down  

Down boy down  
Count me down  
Down boy  
Down boy  

Down boy down  

Hey  

Down  
Count me down  
Down boy down
