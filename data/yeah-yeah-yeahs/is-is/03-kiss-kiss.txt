# Kiss Kiss

Green hours
Blue rope
Well hot wax four heart are cold

We're three
We're three in the dark tonight
And baby my snake is a shark tonight

He's got youth on his side
He's got small purple eyes
Now he's as straight as a bow
When there's nobody home

Hey

Everywhere kiss me
Everywhere kids speak
No catch no beat
Everywhere kiss me
Everywhere kiss me

Everywhere kiss me
Everywhere kids meet
No catch no beat
Everywhere kiss
Everywhere kiss kiss me

Now move I'm gonna come dry
I dropped my musings out of sight
I drank until the waters dried
It's all cute 'til someone dies

Shoot my name up every vein
You can't get hurt you can't complain
No feet no hands no tail no lies
He's got youth on his side

Hey

Everywhere kiss me
Everywhere kids speak
No catch no beat
Everywhere kiss me
Everywhere kiss me

Everywhere kiss me
Everywhere kids meet
No catch no beat
Everywhere kiss
Everywhere kiss kiss me

We're three
We're three
We're three

We're three we're three in the dark tonight
And baby my snake is a shark tonight
