# Dull Life

Want you to stay in a subtle way
Like you're walking again all on me
Step slowly you know that you fall between Dark places what a simple web we weave

We've seen the nightmare
Of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie
Beneath is coming in

We've seen the nightmare
Of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie
Beneath is coming in

Know my soul
Soul
Know my soul

Well all hail the prison queen
Iron bars iron heart
Iron bars everything

A hundred years old
A hundred years old

Last on the village scene
Fall apart iron heart
More alive than you've ever been

We've seen the nightmare
Of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie
Beneath is coming in

We've seen the nightmare
Of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie
Beneath is coming in

Well it's a dull life
It's a dull life
It's a dull life
It's a dark place

It's a dull life
It's a dull life
It's a dull life
It's a dull life

Know my soul

We've seen the nightmare of the lies
We've seen the nightmare of the lies

We've seen the nightmare of the lies
We've seen the nightmare of the lies

We've seen the nightmare of the lies
We've seen the nightmare of the lies

We've seen the nightmare
Of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie
Beneath is coming in

We've seen the nightmare
Of the lies that you speak
The beast that I lie
Beneath is coming in

Know my soul
