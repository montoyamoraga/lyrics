# Hysteric  

No longer no longer  
What you ask  
Strange steps  
Heels turned black  

The cinders the cinders  
They light the path  
And these strange steps  
Take us back take us back  

Flow sweetly  
Hang heavy  
You suddenly complete me  
You suddenly complete me  

Flow sweetly  
Hang heavy  
You suddenly complete me  
You suddenly complete me  

Hysteric  
Hysterical  

No wonder no wonder  
Other half  
Strange steps  
Heels turned black  

The cinders they splinter  
And light the path  
And these strange steps  
Trace us back trace us back  

Flow sweetly  
Hang heavy  
You suddenly complete me  
You suddenly complete me  

Flow sweetly  
Hang heavy  
You suddenly complete me  
You suddenly complete me
