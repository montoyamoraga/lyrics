# Runaway

I was feeling sad
Can't help looking back
Highways flew by

Run run away
No sense of time
Like you to stay
Want to keep you inside

Run run run away
Lost lost lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize

Run run run away
Lost lost lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize

I was feeling sad
Can't help looking back
Highways flew by

Run run away
No sense of time
Like you to stay
Want to keep you inside

All alone
Not so strong
Without these open arms
Hold on tight

All alone
Not that strong
Without these open arms
Lie beside

All alone
Not so strong
Without these open arms
Lie beside

Run run run away
Lost lost lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize

Run run run away
Lost lost lost my mind
Like you to stay
Want you to be my prize
