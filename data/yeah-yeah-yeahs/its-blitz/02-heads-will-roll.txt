# Heads Will Roll

Off with your head
Dance til you're dead
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
On the floor

Glitter on the wet streets
Silver over everything
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome

Dripping with alchemy
Shiver stop shivering
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome

The men cry out the girls cry out
The men cry out the girls cry out
The men cry out oh no

The men cry out the girls cry out
The men cry out the girls cry out
The men cry out oh no

Oh ah
Oh ah

Off off with your head
Dance dance til you're dead
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
On the floor

Looking glass
Take the past
Shut your eyes
Mirror lies

Looking glass
Take the past
Shut your eyes
Mirror lies

Glitter on the wet streets
Silver over everything
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome
You're all chrome

Oh ah
Oh ah

Off off off with your head
Dance dance dance til you're dead
Off off off with your head
Dance dance dance til you're dead

Off off off with your head
Dance dance dance til you're dead
Off off off with your head
Dance dance dance til you're dead

Off off off with your head
Dance dance dance til you're dead
Off off off with your head
Dance dance dance til you're dead
