# Little Shadow

Patience
Shadow
For all your sight
There's no sight to see

Little shadow
Little shadow
To the night
Will you follow me

Pardon
Shadow
Hold on tight
To your darkened key

Little shadow
Little shadow
To the night
Will you follow me

Closer
Shadow
For all your strikes
Still we're caught between

All this sorrow
Little shadow
To the night
Will you follow me

Every shape and size
Deep and deep we dive
Turn and turn we side
To a fantasy

Little shadow
Into the night
Will you follow me

Little shadow
To the night
Will you follow me
