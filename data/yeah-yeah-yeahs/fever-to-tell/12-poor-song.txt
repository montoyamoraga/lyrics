# Poor Song

Baby I'm afraid
Of a lot of things but
I ain't scared
Of loving you

And baby I know
You're afraid of a lot of things
But don't be scared
Of love cause

People will say
All kinds of things
But that don't mean
A damn to me

Cause all I see
Is what's in
Front of me
And that's you

Well I've been dragged
All over the place
I've taken hits
Time just don't erase

And baby I can see
You've been fucked with too
But that don't mean
Your loving days are through

Cause people will say
All kinds of things
But that don't mean
A damn to me

Cause all I see
Is what's in
Front of me
And that's you

Well I may be
Just a fool
But I know
You're just as cool

And cool kids
They belong together
