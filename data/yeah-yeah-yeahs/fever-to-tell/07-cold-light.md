#  Cold Light  

Cold light  
Hot night  
Be my heater be my lover  
And we could do it to each other  

Cold light  
Hot night  
Be my heater be my lover  
And we could do it to each other  

Go go go go go  

Hey  
Oh  

Ride daddy ride  
Ride out the tide  
I'd rather die  
Than hear goodbye  

And watch you go  
Go go go go  

Hey  
Ha  

Ride daddy ride  
Ride out the tide  
I'd rather die  
Than hear goodbye

And watch you go  
Go go go go  

Cold light  
Hot night  
Be my heater be my lover  
And we could do it to each other  

Yeah we could do it to each other  
We're like a sister and a brother  

Go go go go go  

Ha  
Hey  
Ha  

Ha  
Hey  

Ride momma ride  
Ride out the tide  
I'd rather die  
Than hear goodbye
And watch you go
