# Pin  

Things are feeling thin  
Well I know I know  
Lost my seat again  
Well I'll go I'll go  

Pushing in the pin  
Well I know I know  
We're gonna go back in  
We're gonna go go go  

Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam  
Duru duru duru duru  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam  
Duru duru duru duru  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam  
Duru duru duru duru  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam
Bam  

I like to sleep with him  
Pushing in the pin  
I like to sleep with him  
Well I know I know  

We're gonna go back in  
We're gonna go go go  
We're gonna go back in  
We're gonna go go go  

Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam  
Duru duru duru duru  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam  
Duru duru duru duru  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam  
Duru duru duru duru  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam
Bam
