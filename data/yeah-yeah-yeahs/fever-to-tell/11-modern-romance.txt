# Modern Romance

Don't hold on
Go get strong
Well don't you know

There is no
Modern romance

Time time is gone
It stops stops who it wants

Well I was wrong
It never lasts
And there is no
Well this is no
Modern romance

And time time is gone
It never lasts
Stops who it wants

Well I was wrong
It never lasts
This is no
There is no
Modern romance

There is no
Modern romance

This is no
Modern romance

There is no
There is no
