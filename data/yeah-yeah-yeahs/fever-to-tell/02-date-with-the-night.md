# Date With The Night  

I got a date with the night  
Burning out my finger  
Gonna catch the kids dry  
Gonna walk on water  

Buying out the fight  
We're sweating in the winter  
Both thighs squeeze tight  

Choke choke choke choke  
Choke choke choke choke  
Choke choke choke choke  
Choke choke choke choke  

Don't tell me to fix her  
Don't tell me to fix her  
Just take a bite  
No hanging no picture  

Flying out my sight  
Dropping brides at the altar  
Both thighs squeeze tight  

Choke choke choke choke  
Choke choke choke choke  
Choke choke choke choke  
Choke choke choke choke  

I'll set you I'll set it off  
I'll set you I'll set it off  
I'll set you I'll set it off  
I'll set you I'll set it off  

I'll set you I'll set it off  
I'll set you I'll set it off  
I'll set you I'll set it off  
I'll set you I'll set it off  

Buying out the fight  
Gonna walk on water  
Gonna catch the kids dry  
Gonna bend my finger  

Buying out my fight  
We're sweating in the winter  
Both thighs squeeze tight  
Both thighs squeeze tight
