# No No No

Sorry

Well I'm frozen
Like a soldier
Don't know where it stays
All over the place

Time froze
Like an ocean
Don't know the taste
Of a never ending ache

No no no no
Why I hurry when I'm home
I hurry when I'm home
I'll go

No no no no
Why I hurry when I'm home
I hurry when I'm home
I'll go

Oh I'll go

It's really not bad not worse than you thought
He'll never come back he's the man you dropped
He'll never come back he's the man you loved

It's really not bad not worse than you thought
He'll always come back he's the man you dropped
He'll never come back he's the man you loved

I told her
I told her
I'll go

I told her
I told her
I told her
No no no no no

Hey

No no no no
Why I hurry when I'm home
I hurry when I'm home
I'll go

No no no no
Why I hurry when I'm home
I hurry when I'm home
I'll go

Oh I'll go

Shhh

I told her
I told her

I told her
I told her
