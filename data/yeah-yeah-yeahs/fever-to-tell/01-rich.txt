# Rich

I'm rich
Like a hot noise
Rich rich rich
I'll take you out boy

So stuck up
I wish you'd stick it to me
Flesh ripped off

Turning it
Beating no beat
The walls are always speaking
No one no one no one
No speaking at all

She slipped
Down a rot drink
Well unzipped
She doesn't exist

So unloved
I took 'em standing up
So stuck up

I'm rich
Like a hot noise
Rich rich rich
I'll take you out boy

Turning it
Beating no beat
The walls are always speaking
No one no one no one
No speaking at all

Turning it
Beating no beat
The walls are always speaking
No one no one no one
No speaking at all

Rich rich rich rich rich rich
Rich rich rich rich rich rich
Rich rich rich rich rich rich
Rich rich rich rich rich rich

Rich rich rich rich rich rich
Rich rich rich rich rich rich
Rich rich rich rich rich rich
Rich rich rich rich rich rich

Rich rich rich rich rich rich
Rich rich rich rich rich rich
