# Y Control

Oh so all my loving goes
Under the fog fog fog
And I will leave them all
Well I'm just a poor little baby
Cause well I believe them all

Oh so while you're growing old
Under the gun gun gun
And I believe them all
Well I'm just one poor baby
Cause well I believe them all

I wish I could buy back
The woman you stole

Y control
Y control
You walk walk walk walk walk
My winners

Out of control
Out of control
You walk walk walk walk walk
My winners

Out of control
High control
You walk walk walk walk walk
My winners

Out of control
Out of control
You walk walk walk walk walk
My winners out

Oh so all my loving goes
Under the fog fog fog
And I will leave them all
Well I'm just a poor little baby
Cause well I believe them all

I wish I could buy back
The woman you stole

Y control
Y control
You walk walk walk walk walk
My winners

Out of control
Out of control
You walk walk walk walk walk
My winners

Out of control
High control
You walk walk walk walk walk
My winners

Out of control
Out of control
You walk walk walk walk walk
My winners out
