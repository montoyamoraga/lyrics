# Way Out  

Lies and love  
Lies love  
Bed wetting son  
Of the great heat

It's all over me  
It's all under me  
The face ain't making  
What the mouth needs  

Wonder more  
Want more  
Than we did before  
Try the new tease  

Well quiet you  
Get over me  
The shit is running  
And it runs deep  

I'm way out  
Way out  
Way out  
Way out  

When you mean it on the inside  
You still can't get to me  

To me  

Fits around me so tight nah oh  
Fits around me so tight nah oh  
Fits around me so tight nah oh  
Fits around me so tight nah oh  

Fits around me  
Fits around me  
Fits around me  
Fits around me  

Fits around me  
Fits around me  
Fits around me  
Fits around me  

I'm way out  
Way out  
Way out  
Way out  

When you mean it on the inside  
You still can't get to me  

To me  

Ooh oh  
Ooh oh  

Ooh oh ooh oh  
Ooh oh ooh oh
