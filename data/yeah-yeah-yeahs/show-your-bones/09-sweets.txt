# Sweets

Green shadow
Water weight oh all over me
The end
Will shelter me away from me

Can we meet again
Meet and meet
And meet and meet again

Can you fill the can
If you can't fill me

Who you following
Who you starting to
Move like

Who you falling for
Who you falling for
Whose lies

Who you following
Who you falling for
This sound's
On your side

Secret blue
Purple pink and green right over it
Well hold on
Cause the coldest hasn't thawed yet

Well if we meet again
Meet and meet
And meet and meet again

Can you catch the can
If you can't will it

Well how you want
Something to hit with
Spinning again and again and again

What's your crime
What's your crime

Well how will you want
How will she sin
We're spinning again and again and again

What's your crime
What's your
What's your
What's your
What's your

What's your crime
Crime
Crime

What's your
What's your
What's your
What's your
What's your

What's your crime
