Hot cold season gonna sink in my sweat
No one isn't ever gonna make it there yet
If you can't even cope with it
Then you'll pass me by
And you'll take it over
And make it mine

Fast slow living is a holding me back
Wishing that my baby never told me that
I can't even cope to make it last
Then you'll pass me by
And you'll take it over
And make it mine

Then you want it a
Want it a
Want it again

Then you want it a
Want it a
Want it again

Then you want it a
Want it a
Want it again

Then you want it a
Want it a
Want it again

My dear you've been used
I'm breaking the news
Well love nearly beat us
I'm thinking like you

Well I'm thinking of you
Well love follows near us
Can love really steer us
Oh can it be true
Oh can it be true

Lost all reason from playing your games
Better quit staring cause you're looking the same
I can't even cope to make a change
Then you'll pass me by
And you'll take it over
And make it mine

Use me up
Use me up
Taper off and I'm had
