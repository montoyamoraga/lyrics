# Cheated Hearts

Cheated by the opposite of love
Held on high from up up up above
Kept my high from the second one
Kept my eye on the first one

Now take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day

Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day

Well I'm
Takin' takin' takin'
Takin' takin' it off

And she's
Takin' takin' takin'
Takin' takin' it off

And he's
Takin' takin' takin'
Takin' takin' it off

And we're
Takin' takin' takin'
Takin' takin' it off

Sometimes I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well I think that I'm bigger than the sound

She'll take on high
She'll take on high

Well sometimes I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well I think that I'm bigger than the sound
Well I think that I'm bigger than the sound

Cheated by the opposite of love
Held on high from up up up above
Kept my high from the second one
Kept my eye on the first one

Now take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day

Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
Take these rings and stow them safe away
I'll wear them on another rainy day
