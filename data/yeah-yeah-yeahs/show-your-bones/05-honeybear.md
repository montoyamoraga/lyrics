Turn yourself around  
You weren't invited  
Turn yourself around  
You weren't invited  

Good good things  
Happen in bad towns

Run away  
Run away  
You want it  

Run away  
Run away  
You want it  

Run away  
Any way  
You want it  

Run away  
Run away  
You want it  

What  
What did you do to your back  
Kept soft thoughts
Cut lips can't get 'em back  

Junk
Jump off too much talk  
Old hope breeds  
Cold needs undress old keys  

Run away  
Run away  
You want it  

Run away  
Run away  
You want it  

Run away  
Any way  
You want it  

Run away  
Run away  
You want it  

Gone all alone  
I've got a call from the bear  
Gonna take all his honey honey  

Gone all alone  
I've got a call from the bear  
Gonna take all his honey honey  

Gone all alone  
I've got a call from the bear  
Gonna take all his honey honey  

Gone all alone  
I've got a call from the bear  
Gonna take all his honey honey  

Run away  
Run away  
You want it  

Run away  
Run away  
You want it  

Run away  
Any way  
You want it  

Run away  
Run away  
You want it
