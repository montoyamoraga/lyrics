# Mysteries

My arms are all twisted
The only thing I miss is
I messed up
I missed it
I messed up
The missing of you

It's getting to sound like
They've seen you around with her

No mystery
No mystery
No mysteries

Everyone knows
The secretest code of mine
They'll tell all my friends
And they'll tell al my enemies too

Mystery
No mysteries
No mysteries

No mystery
No mystery
No mysteries

Take it away Nick

I don't even know
What it's like not to go back to you
I don't even know
Who I like less

You or me
You or me

It's anyone's anyone's guess
It's anyone's anyone's guess
