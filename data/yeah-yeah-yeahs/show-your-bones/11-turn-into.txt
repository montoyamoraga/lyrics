# Turn Into

I know
What I know
I know
On the car ride down

I hear it in my head
Real low
Turn into
The only thing I ever

Turn into
Hope I do
Turn into you

I know
What I know
Well I know
That girl you found

Keeps that
Kind of window closed
She'll turn into
The only thing you ever

Turn into
Hope I do
Turn into you

Can't say why I kept this from you
My those quiet eyes become you
Leave it where it can't remind us
Turn this all around behind us

Oh well I know
Well I'll fall right in
To keep you out
I'd like to tell you
All about it

I know
What I know
I know
This last time 'round

I'll hear it
In my head real low
Turn into
The only thing you ever know

The only thing you ever know

I know
What I know
Well I know
Ah yes
