# Mystery Girl  

It was the struggle of the century  
And all the grown men came to see  
The girl who could tame the tiger yeah yeah  
The heart of the southern lovebirds  

They found her under the sea  
She said she came from cell block three  
The girl hit hard like a barracuda baby  
She floated on air like the crest of a wave  
She was a primal institution  
She was a danger to herself yeah  

Mad loving by the cold-hearted  
Take a deep breath babe  
Cause we just started  

Mystery girl mystery girl  
Keep on faking your mystery world  
Cause the mystery boys will be your toys yeah  
The mystery boys will be your toys  

Not a days goes by I wanna disappear  
Into her eyes a mother of pearl  
And my head feels dead from all this useless fighting  
But my heart ain't dead cause it keeps on loving  

The girl hit hard like a barracuda baby  
She floated on air like the crest of a wave  
She was a primal institution  
She was a danger to herself yeah  

Mad loving by the cold-hearted  
Take a deep breath babe  
Cause we just started  

Mystery girl mystery girl yeah  
Keep on faking your mystery world  
Cause the mystery boys will be your toys yeah  
The mystery boys will be your toys yeah  


The mystery boys will be your toys yeah  
The mystery boys will be your toys
They'll be your toys yeah girl  
They'll be your toys yeah alright
