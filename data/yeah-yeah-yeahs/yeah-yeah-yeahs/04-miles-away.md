# Miles Away  

As the cars go by under the sun like an enemy  
You wonder you wonder you wonder  
As a spider comes and looks at you like an enemy  
You wonder you wonder you wonder yeah  

Miles miles away  
She's hurt fewer people in a better world  
Miles miles away  
Dressed again in the hot water  

And you're more beautiful than ever  
Looking in the car's rear view mirror  

The floor is hard uncomforted  
By the second time  
She wonders she hungers  
She hungers like a killer's wife  

As the cars go by  
As the cars go by  
As the cars go by  
Yeah as the cars go by  

Miles miles away  
She's hurt fewer people in a better world  
Miles miles away  
Dressed again in the hot water  

Well you're more beautiful than ever  
Looking in the car's rear view mirror  
Yeah you're more beautiful than ever  

Miles miles miles miles away   
Miles miles away
