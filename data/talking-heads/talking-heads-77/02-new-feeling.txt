# New Feeling

It's not
Yesterday
Anymore

I go visiting
I talk loud
I try to make myself
Clear

In front
Of a face
That's nearer
Than it's ever been before
Not this close before
Nearer than before
Not this close before

It is
A million
Years ago

I hear music
And it sounds like bells
I feel like my head is
High

I wish
I could meet
Everyone

Meet them all over again
Bring them up to my room
Meet them all over again
Everyone's up in my room

And now
Now I'm busy
Busy again

I feel like sitting down
But I'm still thinking
Thinking about my friends

In
My guarded
Moments

But now I'm speaking out
Speaking about my friends
Now I'm speaking out
Thinking about my friends
