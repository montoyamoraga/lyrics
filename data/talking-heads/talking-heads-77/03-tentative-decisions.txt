# Tentative Decisions

Now that I can
Release my tensions
Let me make clear
My best intentions

Girls ask can I
Define decision
Boys ask can I
Describe their function

Oh the boys
Want to talk
Would like to
Talk about those problems

And the girls
Say they're concerned
That they are
Concerned with these decisiveness

And it's a
Hard logic
To follow
And the
Girls get lost

And the boys
Say they're concerned
That they are
Concerned with decisiveness

I wanna talk
I wanna talk as much as I want
I'm gonna give
I'm gonna give the problem to you

I wanna talk
I wanna talk as much as I want
I'm gonna give
I'm gonna give the problem to you

Decide decide
Make up your mind
Decide decide
I told you what to say

Confuse confuse
Describe what I found
Confuse confuse
I told you what to say

Oh the girls
Still want to talk
Would like to
Talk about those problems

And the boys
Say they're concerned
That they are
Concerned with decisiveness

And it's a
Hard logic
I know
And the
Girls get lost

And the boys
Say they're concerned
That they are
Concerned with decisiveness

I wanna talk
I wanna talk as much as I want
I'm gonna give
I'm gonna give the problem to you

I wanna talk
I wanna talk as much as I want
I'm gonna give
I'm gonna give the problem to you

Decide decide
Make up your mind
