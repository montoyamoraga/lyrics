# Happy Day

In my sensations
I believe that I was
Born with the things that I know

I want to talk
Like I read
Before I decide what to do

And I fell all over
And I couldn't stand up
I can't be critical
A heart won't stop

Such a happy day
For me
Bring that happy day
To me

Send that happy day
To me
And that happy day
Came to me
Come to me
Here it comes

I'm only looking
Feel like my heart
Has a will of its own

I feel feel nice inside
Right here
And now it's summer again

The story I told
The story I made up
I was fooling around
But a heart can't stop

Such a happy day
For me
Bring that happy day
To me

Send that happy day
To me
And that happy day
Came to me
Come to me
Here it comes

This boy is in motion
Some density
Moved right beside me

I want my sentence
Right here
But now I'm far away

A sign was given but
Many years have passed
It cost a little bit to love you
But a heart can't stop

Such a happy day
For me
Bring that happy day
To me

Send that happy day
To me
And that happy day
Came to me
Come to me
Here it comes

It's alright
