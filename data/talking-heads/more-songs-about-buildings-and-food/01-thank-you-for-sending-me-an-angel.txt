# Thank You For Sending Me An Angel

Oh baby you can walk you can talk just like me
You can walk you can talk just like me
You can look tell me what you see
You can look you won't see nothing like me
If you look around the world

Oh baby you can walk you can talk just like me
With a little practice you can walk you can talk just like me
Well you can look you'll walk in circles around me
But first I'll walk in circles around you
But first I walk around the world

I'm walking around the world here we go
You can walk a little
I'll walk in circles around you
But first show me what you can do
