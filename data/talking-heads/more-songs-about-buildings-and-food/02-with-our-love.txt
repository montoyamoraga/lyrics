# With Our Love

It's just a look and it makes the boys quiver
Yes it's the look and now they remember
Had they forgotten what this all means
I think they want to forget
And they hope that this time
Not this time

I won't look
I've got other things to do now
I forgot what it was
I've got to get to work now
They set an example for us I see it
It can happen to me too and it
Didn't make any difference to us but I
Forgot the trouble that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble that's the trouble
With our love
With our love
With our love

They hear the words such as you're really special
And they can't face that feeling
And they can't really tell
I look out the window and I
I call that education and I
I see all my friends standing out there and I
I call that education sophistication

They're not so busy
That they won't be affected
Because things come and go and I see them
But I won't be neglected not this time

I won't look
I've got other things to do now
I forgot what it was
I've got to get to work now
They set an example for us I see it
It can happen to me too and it
Didn't make any difference to us but I
Forgot the trouble that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble that's the trouble
Forgot the trouble that's the trouble
With our love
With our love
With our love
