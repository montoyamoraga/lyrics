# I Should Watch TV

I used to think that I should watch TV
I used to think that it was good for me
Wanted to know what folks were thinking
To understand the land I live in
And I would lose myself
And it would set me free

This is the place where common people go
A global franchise one department store
Yes there were many awkward moments
I had to do some self atonement
Well if I opened up
Well it would set me free

I know I like
Behold and love this giant
Big soul big lips
That's me and I am this
Everybody gets a touched up hairdo
Everybody's in the passing lane
Had a reason that she touched all channels
The weird things that live in there

I took a walk down to the park today
I wrote a song called just like you and me
I heard the jokes from the sports reporter
The rival teams when they faced each other
The more I lost myself the more it set me free

How am I not your brother
How are you not like me
Everybody's in the hotel lobby
I'm blending in here yes I am
I feel it moving in my arms and fingers
Touch me and feel my pain

It's good to lose and it's good to win sometimes
It's good to die and it's good to be alive
Maybe someday we can stand together
Not afraid of what our eyes might see
Maybe someday understand them better
The weird things inside of me
