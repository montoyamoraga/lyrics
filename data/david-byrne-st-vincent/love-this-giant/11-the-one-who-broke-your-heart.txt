# The One Who Broke Your Heart

All the beautiful people
They did some work on your face
And in that struggle for freedom
Everyone looks the same that's right
And everybody is pregnant
And everybody's in pain
We're all pushing and shoving
to make those human beings

Although they say you're aristocracy
That's what they say
We all deserve to wear that crown

Sing along with the one who broke your heart
You know you do
Sing aloud it will keep you safe and warm
That's right

Ho ho
ho ho

In the Garden of Eden
On a hot summer day
We were totally naked
Outside that small caf√©

Am I the one you imagined
Am I heaven or hell
But no one else can compare to
The way you love yourself
You know you do

I came to tell you on this bicycle
The tree and houses say hello

Sing along with the one who broke your heart
You know you do
Sing aloud it will keep you safe and warm
That's right
I dreamed a dream in the middle of the night
I guess I did
I sing along to open up those teary eyes

Faster and faster
And no one's holding the wheel
Interstate highway
Through those cities and fields
Your friends and family
They tell your secrets to me
It's not so impressive
Until they all disappear

Ho ho
Ho ho
Ho ho
Ho ho

Sing along with the one who broke your heart
You know you do
I dreamed a dream wake up and there you are
