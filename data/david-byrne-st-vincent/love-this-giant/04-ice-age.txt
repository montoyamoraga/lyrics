# Ice Age

Oh diamond how we've been
Oh diamond it's such a shame
To see you this way
Freezing it out
Your own little ice age

Ice age
Ice age

Oh diamond get outta bed
All unbuttoned seams are showing
And you're freaking me out
Freezing it out
Your own little ice age

Ice age
Ice age
Ice age
Ice age

We won't know how much we've lost
Until the winter thaws
We won't know just what we lost
Until your winter thaws

Oh diamond
Where have you been
It's close to your bones
It's far for from your shell
So feel it away reason it out
Your own little ice age

Hey hey
Thaw me out thaw me out
Hey hey
Thaw me out thaw me out

Hey hey
Thaw me out thaw me out
Hey hey
Thaw me out thaw me out

Hey hey
Thaw me out thaw me out
Hey hey
Thaw me out thaw me out
