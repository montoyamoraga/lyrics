# Lightning

There's a funny lightning
Threatening with striking
But it moves too quick for a picture

There's a funny lightning
Round the corner hiding
But I'm too smart just to catch it
With gloves and rubber

So I stay put right there
Watching the sky for tears
Let the fools and cowboys roar to wrecks

But if I should wake up
And find my home's in half
Who is it blame nature
I guess I have to laugh

And if I should wake up
And find my bed has moved
Six inches six closer
To the west

But this funny lightning
I wanna invite in
If I could learn how to teach it

I salt the corners of
My room because because
A ghost can never be too careful

And if I should wake up
And find my home's in half
Who did it Oh nature
I hope you have a laugh

And if I should wake up
And find my bed has moved
Twelve inches twelve closer
To my god

Whip crash there's a flash
And I'm back to wanting more
The crack is moving up the wall

Whip crash there's a flash
And I'm back to wanting more
I can't help thinking this is war

Whip crash there's a flash
And I'm back to wanting more
The crack is moving up the wall

Whip crash there's a flash
And I'm back to wanting more
I can't help thinking this is war
