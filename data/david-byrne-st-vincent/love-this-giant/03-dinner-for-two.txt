# Dinner For Two

By the time the guests arrive
Ooh already it was dark outside
Tables set with china dishes
We're welcomed in with tiny kisses
What's her name I don't remember
Isn't that the famous author
Harry's gonna get some appetizers
Well he's keeping out of range of small arms fire
Dina has a phone she says it's working
Now she's crawling on the floor across the kitchen

Something I should tell you
But we are never alone

Tanks outside the bedroom window
We'll be okay with the curtain closed
The guests are fine behind the sofa
It's much too late they should not go home

Something I should tell you
But we are never alone

Up by dawn already morning
I ask myself what is going on
Some tender words and sidelong glances
Are you okay have you lived here long

Underneath the stairway
Somebody's changing her clothes
Sweatpants and a T-shirt
Silk dresses cover the floor

Sit down by my side
Take my overcoat
When will we get out
Maybe a week or soon

Some of us losing it
Some of us breaking down
Some of us stick it out
Used to it now

Something I should tell you
But we are never alone
There's something I should tell you
And I've been waiting so long

When it's over with
Going our separate ways
How about you and me
Dinner for two
