# Weekend In The Dust

Once so mysterious
Now decoded and used
Now according to you you
What's so mysterious

Once so mysterious
Now decoded and used
Now according to you you
What's so mysterious

Wear it well
Well you have worn it out
Give it all
Well could you give it up
Where's the fun
In holding all the cards
Everyone
Gets up when you sit down

I don't get it
Just don't get it
I don't get it
Just don't

I don't get it
Just don't get it
I don't get it
Just don't

I don't get it
Just don't get it
I don't get it
Just don't

I don't get it
Just don't get it
I don't get it
Just don't

I don't get it
Just don't get it
I don't get it
Just don't

I don't get it
Just don't get it
I don't get it
Just don't

When the party's over we can call the dog
Dare to keep our shirts on rolling in the muck

Weekend in the dust
Weak and full of blood

If you're real
I'll be a hologram
Why have none
When you can have it all

I don't get it
Just don't get it
I don't get it
Just don't

I don't get it
Just don't get it
I don't get it
Just don't

I don't get it
Just don't get it
I don't get it
Just don't

I don't get it
Just don't get it
I don't get it
Just don't

I don't get it
Just don't get it
I don't get it
Just don't

I don't get it
Just don't get it
I don't get it
Just don't
