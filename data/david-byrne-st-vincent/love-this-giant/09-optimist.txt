# Optimist

Waiting but I don't mind
I'm all bus stops and heat
I'm neon in your daylight
I'm the optimist of Thirtieth Street
How it is is how it oughta be

I've got anything but moneyed esteem
The drinks on Cond√© Nast
I'm the optimist of Thirtieth Street
How it is is how it oughta be

I spy Vivian Girls on the up upper east
There's no reason to be upset
There's no reason to not expect

There's no room for emptiness
No tea or sympathy
There's no room for emptiness
On a never empty street
