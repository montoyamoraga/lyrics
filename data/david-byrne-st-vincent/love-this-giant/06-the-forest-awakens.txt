# The Forest Awakens

The forest awakes
The desert at dawn
A mountain at night
And the rhythm moves on

The people awake
They're marching along
The streets are alive
With a terrible song

Forwards and backwards in every direction
The atoms' perpetual motion
The shifting of light
On the banks of the river
I'm free but I'm keeping my clothes on

I'm marching along
The street where you live
I'm calling your name
The song is a gift
The song is a road
The road is a face
A face is a time
And a time is a place

A place of relief in a time of confusion
A heart is a simple equation
With beautiful words and beautiful people
A song is a face is a mountain

A fruit that falls before it's grown
I heard a sound and a bird has flown
It breaks to pieces above the forest
A million particles born today

Out beyond the blue horizon
Air cannot escape
Underneath the weeping willow
I can see your face

Free form calling all over me
Creatures big and small
Doctors pulling them out of you
Hideous virtuous both of us

Come in my kitchen
When it rains outside
Sweet inspiration
Sneaks up from behind

The forest is true
I know for a fact
That the bigger the front
Then the bigger the back

My heart beating still
Through the perilous night
The bombs burst in the air
But my hair is alright

The shifting of light on the trees and the houses
I drowned in an ocean of perfume
The strangeness of words how the meaning keeps changing
But somehow the beauty will find you
