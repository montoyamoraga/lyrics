# Outside Of Space And Time

My love
Your house has many rooms
The kitchen's filled with food
I'll find a place inside

The dreams that pass across your face
Come from a secret place
Everyone close your eyes

It's true
I am a shaky ladder
Intergalactic matter
Outside of space and time

But who is standing on your street
These buildings are not real
My tricks are useless here

It's true
That's what a lover hears
It's a what fool believes
It's not too late to try

Someday
I'll step out from the shadows
Intergalactic matter
Outside of space and time

Dirty feet
Crooked teeth
Somewhere out beyond the stars
A funny face
Some lost in space
Are we

Everyone's enlightened everyday
You may reach nirvana when you comb your hair

I know
We'll join this cosmic saga
Intergalactic matter
Where we will meet tonight
Spiraling out of sight
Outside of space and time
