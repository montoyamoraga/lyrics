# Who

Who'll be my valentine
Who'll lift this heavy load
Who'll share this taxi cab
Who wants to climb aboard

Who is an honest man
Who is an honest man

Who'll help the tired soldier
Far from his own hometown
Carry these men and women
Who get lost when the sun goes down

Who is an honest man
Who is an honest man

Who walks this dusty road
Who always pulls their weight
Who's this inside of me
Who made a big mistake

Who sees these constellations
Seen in those spinning round
Carry these men and women
Who get lost when the sun goes down

Who is an honest man
Who is an honest man

With a graceful motion she sat down slowly
Drank a cup of coffee and she'll fold her laundry
She begins to tell us all her life story
All around the table everybody's staring

Who shouts out hallelujah
Who's gonna sing out loud
Carry these men and women
Who gets lost when the sun goes down

Who's getting out of there
Who thinks they're wide awake
Who's gonna be my friend
All around the table everybody's staring
