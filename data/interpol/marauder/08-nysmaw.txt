# NYSMAW

Like Prince sang in Tennessee
I wanna ride with you down there
To Alphabet Street

And we can whisper with the stars
Like when the world began
And we can leak some beliefs skyward

Sinking in
Driving
Moving in
Cool climates

Give me the oversight
Inside the other
Give me the oversight
Inside the fantasy

And with these inclinations
They will design a little box
For you to play in

Oh aimless sharks
Don't react to soft attentions
They know how to wait

Swooping in
Silent
Moving in
Cool
Firing

Give me the oversight
Inside the other
Give me the oversight
Inside the other's dream

Is it safe are we far for the mountains
We walk through the trees
Is is safe sing a song for the zeros
Nothing is memory
Blind like the censors
Seeking my surround

Give me the oversight
Inside the other
Primitive over mind
Designs of ecstasy

You're reaching into my heart
And grinding fists in my soul
Give me the oversight
Inside the other's dream

Now you've seen me at work
Now you've seen me at work
Are you excited dear
