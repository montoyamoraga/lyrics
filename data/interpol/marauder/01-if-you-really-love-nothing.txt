# If You Really Love Nothing

If you really love nothing
On what future
Do we build illusions

If you really love nothing
Do we wait in silent glory

If you really love nothing
What part of betrayal
Do you wish to deny

When I find my home
The next artery
Splendid I bled my whole life
So it's probably a kiss
Goodbye then

If you really love nothing
Everybody's made up
Everybody's losing

If you really love nothing
Shall we sleep in silent glory

If you really love nothing
How could you be there
You could just leave forever

When I find my home
The next artery
Splendid I bled my whole life
So it's probably a kiss
Goodbye then

It's goodbye then
You can trace a hole upon your dress
On your dress
On your dress
On your dress

Breath in it's optimal
Read and remember
The week's end grading
Better than seven other men
Wayward from women who break dimension
I know that you could just leave forever

When I find my home
The next artery
Splendid I bled my whole life
So it's probably a kiss
Goodbye then
This is goodbye then

You can trace a hole upon your dress
And give me goodbye and a kiss
I see you trace that hole upon your chest
Give me goodbye and a kiss
