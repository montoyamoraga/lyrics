# It Probably Matters

I tried to be a faithful man
I tried to hide a taste for the anger
I didn't indicate that I care
Every time you'd walk away I'd bring it outside
Cause I didn't have the grace or the brains yeah

It probably matters
It probably matters and
I didn't have the grace or the brains

And it probably mattered
It probably mattered
I was pawning my days away

By the seaside then
On the beach with my friends
Wanna see you dive in

When did you ever hesitate to be mine
It was hard to keep the pace
When you were land sliding
I tried to be a faithful friend
Couldn't always keep you safe
When we were ending
But I always had the time
For the medicine yeah

It probably matters
It probably matters and
I didn't have the grace or the brains

And it probably matters
It probably mattered and
I was pawning my days away

By the seaside then
On the beach with my friends
Wanna see you dive in

Beyond the reef it's thriving
On the beach we're rising
Wanna see you dive in
Oh yeah

I need answers
I need answers
I need answers
In the end we'll meet again

I need answers
In the end we'll meet again
By the seaside then
In the end we'll meet again

How many hours I gave for this
How many hours of pain and bliss

How many hours I gave for this
It probably matters

How many hours I gave for this
It probably matters

How many hours of pain and bliss
It probably matters

How many hours I gave for this
It probably matters
