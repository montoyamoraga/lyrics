# Flight of Fancy

Who reigns in that silence
When you sleep in the afternoon
You reach out to emptiness
Until the reaching out feels empty too

We'll come to my darling yeah
Or we'll wake up to someone new
Who makes up the fundamental
The fundamental you

This was made for me
This is make believe
Like sleight of hand
And a custom vagrancy of mind

Well I demand it
It's just my agency
My flight of fancy
Flight of fancy
I demand it

You reach out to freedom
You reach out to be consumed
There's a part of you starving
There's a part of me that over blooms

The sun stains the ocean yeah
The pink house return to gloom
And becomes the fundamental
The elemental hue

This was made for me
This is make believe
Like sleight of hand
And a custom vagrancy of mind

Well I demand it
It's just my agency
My flight of fancy
Flight of fancy
