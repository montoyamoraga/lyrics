# Mountain Child

Mountain child
You're up in the trees like a heathen
Running wild
A scrape on your knees from the descent

Are you out of your head
Why you out of my bed now
Mountain child with your star
Won't you come along with me

Mountain child
The snake in the reeds had me reeling
The smoke in the sky is clear in your eye
It's a lean prophecy that I'm reading

Are you out of your head
Why you out of my bed now
Mountain child you are my queen in white
Won't you come along with me yeah

Show me what it is
What you use it for
I've seen you so high like a meteor

Show me what it is
What you use it for
I watch it roll by like a cannon ball

Up the range
We can try to hike for days yeah

Show me what it is
What you use it for
And come along with me yeah

I wanna live at home
But this time keeps moving backwards
No one will ever know
That my mountain child is strange
And I'm a kind of hero

Hero
We used to rule back then
Hero
What did we used to rule back then

Hero
What did we used to rule back then
Hero
We used to rule back then
