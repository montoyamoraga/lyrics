Your secret's safe here it'll never leave
It's in the basement for ya na'mean
Won't seek replacements my ballerina
There's many faces in my gallery

It gets old

Ella
Teletext or you can call me
Gallivanting heart
I don't know what week it's under

Your secret's safe here it'll never leave
It's in the basement for ya

Ella
I don't know what week it's under
Ella
Go and talk to Steve about it

Gallivanting heart
I don't know what week it's under
Ella
It gets old
It gets old

Don't need replacement
Your secret's safe here
