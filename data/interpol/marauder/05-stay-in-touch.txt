# Stay in Touch

I came to see you in starlight
Heaven receives and so did you
Dimming the blue sky
So much release in a rendezvous

But I didn't really step in
We tasted the cream I went back to Manhattan
It was one time and
You're a scent on the breeze ever since

Leave my head to spin
Rush
Forward to leave my head to spin
Rush
Stay in touch

When we first met you were love tied
Faith like a tree and laying roots
He could see you as his wife then
Honestly I could see it too
Then he became my close friend
We spoke of his love for you often
I came to see you in starlight
And let electric fields yield to skin

Leave my head to spin
Rush
Forward to leave my bed in sin
Rush
Stay in touch

That's how you lose
That's how you lose
I came to see you in starlight
Over the trees amen

That's how you make a ghost
Watch how you break things you learn the most
Something about the one that negates hope
Marauder chained of no real code

Marauder breaks bonds
Marauder stays long
Plays with the real face on
See I touched an angel's wing

She laid it over me
Approach a remedy
Played with the real face on
See I touched an angel's wing

She held it over me
We had the real face on
Something about a reckoning
