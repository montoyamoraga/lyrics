# Party's Over

I can see you on internet
That's your mileu
Practically you are intimate
Suds in the tub

I keep up with your interests
Who's that beside you
Making the cut
I'll say he's smiling

These enhance
My bad intentions
Without containing
My sense of wonder

Let them come crash it
Party's over
No keys and we had to smash it
Party's over

Rock 'n' roll bitch I'm into it
I like to show you my stuff
Baby cheetahs the Himalayas
What's got you startled umbilical

Leading hand
Keeps the distance
Sliding stance
Piece resistance

Let them come crash it
Party's over
No keys and we had to smash it
Party's over

There was some great neighbors who found me
And would not give up to strangers my care
Away from me now
Things come unhanded
Off the rails some

I knew you I need you too
Your trying no reason to
In silence
No reason given
No reason to

Let them come crash it
Party's over
The season can hang beside it
Party's over

And so it ends
And so it ends
I'm going in

I'm going in
And so it ends
And so it ends
