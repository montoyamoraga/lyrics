# The Rover

Come and see me and maybe you'll die
But I can keep you in artwork the fluid kind
That's enough for excitements today
Prostrated faded it's pay to play

Come and see me yeah maybe you'll try
I've been holding these pyros til they could fly
Open up and enlighten again
Enjoy the skyline it's an incremental end

Walk in on your own feet
Says the rover
It's my way or they all leave
Says the rover
Ooh
The rover

Ã‡a suffit hell yeah maybe it's time
You can't stick to the highways it's suicide
I'm welling up with excitements again
The apex resolves you need to tell your friends

Walk in on your own feet
Says the rover
It's my way or they all leave
Says the rover
Ooh
The rover
Ooh
The rover

Come and see me yeah baby let's cry
Satin face in some worlds we'd be too kind
Nature's subjected to fires again
Falling for my independence

Walk in on your own feet
Says the rover
You were high and on the wrong street
Til the rover

Said hop in all in
The rover
Hop in all in
The rover
Ooh
The rover
Hop in
All in
The rover
He barely has to seek repentants
