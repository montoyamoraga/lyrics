# The Lighthouse

This place is set to break
It's just as safe from the outside tonight

And I want that
I face the storms appetite
From the lighthouse

And I want that
I embrace the storm and the night

Whole

What do the waves have to say now
What do the waves have to say now now

Slow now

And let the waves have their way now
Slow
And let the waves have their day

And I want that

Here I've been living
Unloosened from sin
Upward and outward
Begin
Begin

Here I've been loosened
Unliving within
Inwardly urgent
I'm sinking again

The lighthouse
