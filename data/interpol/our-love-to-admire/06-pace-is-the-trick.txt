# Pace Is The Trick

You can't hold it too tight
These matters of security
You don't have to be wound so tight
Smoking on the balcony

Well it's like sleaze in the park
You women you have no self-control
We angels remark outside
You are known for insatiable means
But I don't know a thing

I've seen love
And I follow the speed in the starlight
I've seen love
And I follow the speed in the star-swept night

Yeah pace is the trick
And to all the destruction in man

Well I see you as you take your pride
My lioness
Your defenses seem wise
I cannot press
And attentions are demise
My lioness
Can't you hurt it some
I think I hurt it

I've seen love
And I follow the speed in the starlight
I've seen love
And I follow the speed in the star-swept night

And now I select you
Slow now I let you
See how I stun
See how I stun

Now I select you
Slow now I bet you
See how I stun
See how I stun

And to all the destruction in man
And to all the corruption in my hand

And now I select you
Slow now I let you
See how I stun
See how I stun

Now I select you
Slow now I bet you
See how I stun
See how I stun

Now I select you
I've seen love
Slow now I let you
See how I stun
See how I stun

Now I select you
I've seen love
Slow now I let you
I always follow the speed in the star-swept night

You don't hold a candle
You don't hold a candle
You don't hold a candle
