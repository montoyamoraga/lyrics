# The Scale

I have a sequin for an eye
Pick a rose and hide my face
This is a bandit's life it comes and goes
And them's the breaks

Under a molten sky beyond the road
We lie in wait
You think they know us now
Wait til the stars come out

You see that
I made you
And now I take you back
It's too late
But today I can define the lack
I made you
And now I take you back

Son you sleep in clouds of fire
That's all and that's right
My son you sleep in clouds of fire
That's all and that's right

I can still feel it when you lie
Pick a rose just to hide my face
Well if there's something I should know
I seek no science where there is no shade

Under a molten sky
Let the days collide
Well I made you an
Now I take you back

Son you sleep in clouds of fire
That's all and that's right
My son you sleep in clouds of fire
That's all and that's right
