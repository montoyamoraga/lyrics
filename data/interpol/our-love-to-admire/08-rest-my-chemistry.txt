# Rest My Chemistry

I haven't slept for two days
I've bathed in nothing but sweat
And I've made hallways
Scenes for things to regret
My friends they come
And the lines they go by

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

I live my life with no pain
Just some rage and three kinds of yes
And I've made stairways
Such scenes for things that I regret
Oh those days in the sun
They bring a tear to my eye

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

But you're so young
You're so young
You look in my eyes
You're so young
So sweet so surprised

I saw a sign it says OK
Gotta take a ride
Just recline in the faraway
Gotta take some time to realize
That my friends they come
And the lines they go by

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

But you're so young
You're so young
You look in my eyes
So young
So sweet so surprised
You look so young
Like a daisy in my lazy eye

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry

Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
Tonight I'm gonna rest my chemistry
