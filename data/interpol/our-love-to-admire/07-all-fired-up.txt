# All Fired Up

I dream of you draped in wires
And leaning on the brakes
As I lead you with restless liars
And dealers on the take
And I can read you like a gumshoe
Watch this meeting hall sweat and shake

I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you all on

I'll take you on
Oh I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you on

I haven't struck you with desire
Fault line no crutch no stall
And I can bind you with no ties
Or leash and watch you fall

See I got this soul
It's all fired
This soul
I got this soul
It's all fired up
This soul
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up

I teach you of death's desires
Reflected in lakes
As I lead you in a fearful file
To a precipice of fate
And I welcome you I welcome your sweethearts
That bleed and break

I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you all on

I'll take you on
When your your will is gone
I'll take you on
I'll take you on

I haven't struck you with desire
Fault line no crutch no stall
And I can bind you with no ties
Or lease time and watch you fall

See I got this soul
It's all fired
This soul
I got this soul
It's all fired up
This soul
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
It's all fired up
You're all mine

You're all mine
You're all mine
You're all mine
You're all mine
You're all mine
