# Wrecking Ball

Can it be true

Nobody warned you
Nobody told you
To make up your mind

Nobody told you
That I could
Just waltz through
And shake up your style

I'm inside
Like a wrecking ball through your eyes
And I change it all from inside

Don't wait
Strange and fine
All this hardware

Don't wait
Slope of time
And that's one for me

Don't wait
Go inside
Going somewhere

Don't wait
Hopeless tactile
And that's one for me

Don't wait
Open wide
Yawn like new year

Nobody warned you
Nobody told you
To make up your mind

Nobody told you
That I could
Just waltz through
And shake up your style

I'm inside
Like a wrecking ball through your eyes
And I change it all from inside

Don't wait
Strange and fine
All this hardware

Don't wait
Slope of time
And that's one for me

Don't wait
Go inside
Going somewhere

Don't wait
Hopeless tactile
And that's one for me

Don't wait
Open wide
Yawn like new year

Stay and fight
Stay and fight
