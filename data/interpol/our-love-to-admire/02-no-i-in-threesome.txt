# No I In Threesome

Through the storms and the light
Baby you stood by my side
And life is wine

But there are days in this life
When you see the teeth marks of time
Two lovers divide

Sound meets sound babe
The echoes they surround
And all that we need is one thing
Now what is there to allow

Babe it's time
We give something new a try
Oh alone we may fight
So just let us be three

And baby tonight
I see your lips are on fire
And life is wine

Now the windows are open
The moon is so bright
Cause no one can tell us
What love brings for you and I

Sound meets sound babe
The echoes they surround
And all that we need is one thing
Now what is there to allow

Babe it's time
We give something new a try
Oh alone we may fight
So just let us be three tonight

Through the storms and the light
Baby you stood by my side
And life is wine

You feel the sweet breath of time
It's whispering the truth not mine
There's no I in threesome

And I am all for it

Babe it's time
We give something new a try
Oh alone we may fight
And feathers bend like trees
In the moonlight

Babe it's time
We give something new a try
Oh alone we may fight
So just let us be three tonight
