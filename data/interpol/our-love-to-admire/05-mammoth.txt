Spare me the suspense
Spare me the suspense
I got no currency
But I'm heaven sent

So spare me the suspense
Just spare me the suspense

Hey lady wraith
Oh I so hope you try
You're late
Babe you know it's your time

I won't let you sit by
So cold in the pitch night
Alone you can't make amends

No I won't let you sit by
So cold in the pitch night
We should dance like two fucking twins

Just spare me the suspense

There are seven ancient pawnshops along the road
I know seven aching daddies you may want to know

Oh right on

Hey lady wraith
Oh baby I can't deny
I got a taste
A taste and it's time

But I won't let you sit by
So cold in the pitch night
Alone you can't make amends

No I won't let you sit by
So cold in the pitch night
It's enough with this fucking incense

Just spare me the suspense

There are seven ancient pawnshops along the road
Oh I know seven aching daddies you may want to know

When you played your heart out
You made me turn around

Oh right on

Wait
Oh you froze in the night
You're late
There's a hole in the sky
No haste
No lesson no lie
Got a taste
That I can't deny

Spare me the suspense

And you wait
Til you know that it's time
You wait
Til you know that it's time

You wait
Til you know that it's time
You wait
Til you know that it's time

You say to me
Set black fires
Do you know

You say to me
Set black fires
