# Pioneer To The Falls

Show me the dirt pile
And I will pray
That the soul can take
Three stowaways

Vanish with no guile
And I will not pay
But the soul can wait
The soul can wait

Well it is still pretty
What with all these leaks
We'll be fine
We'll be fine

But if it's still pretty
What with all these leaks
Will we find oh
And supervise

Show me the dirt pile
And I will pray
That the soul can take
Three stowaways

And you vanish with no guile
And I will not pay
But the soul can wait
I felt you so much today

Oh no you try
You flight straight into my heart
You flight straight into my heart

Girl I know you try
You flight straight into my heart
You flight straight into my heart

But here comes the falls

So much for make believe and not so
So much for dreams deceit
But not prepared to know
Your heart makes me feel
Your heart makes me bold
For always and ever
I'll never let go
Always concealed
Safe and inside
Alive

Show me the dirt pile
And I will pray
That the soul can take
Three stowaways

In a passion it broke
I pull the black from the gray
But the soul can wait
I felt you so much today
