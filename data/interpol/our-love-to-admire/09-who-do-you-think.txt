# Who Do You Think

Slow decay I won't stop fighting yet

Who do you think that is there
I came to fight
I am in the air
I know you follow the body
Let go now
To the cold step hypnotic we go

I only call them
When I know
I don't see them

I only call them
When I know
I don't see them

Who do you think that is there
I show beyond slow beyond compare
I always fall in these fights I know why
Always fall in these fights I know why
Controlling the age it takes a toll on my brain
Now who do you think that is there

Only call them
When I know
I don't see them

I only call them
When I know
I don't see them

Slow decay I won't

Who do you think that is there
Bite to stripe leading out of despair
I know you follow the body
Let go now
To the cold step hypnotic
It won't stop now
You fake it with taste
Don't mean you're making your own way
Now who do you think
I said who do you think now

Oh how I pass the days
You know how much I care
Oh through the wax and wane
You know I will be there
Oh at your faded grace
I know not to stare

But slow decay I won't stop fighting yet

Who do you think that is there
I came to fight
I am in the air
I always fall in these fights
I know why
And from the birth strains of life I go right
But controlling my age it takes a toll on my brain
Now who do you think that is there

Only call them
When I know
I don't see them

I only call them
When I know
I don't see them
