# Safe Without

I'm not the hero out the gate
So much to feel so much to gain
My higher reason will take aim
I'll be okay I've got my shapes
We are not alone we share our stake
And I think the winter will be wonderful

I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without

I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without

Go alone we'll split the chase
To all the roll or drop the weight
There's no allegiance step to take
These great big sheets disintegrate
You don't wanna
You don't wanna

I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without

I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without

I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without it
I am safe without

But I feel this way
Feel this way
I steal I kneel I do it again
Over and over and over and over
