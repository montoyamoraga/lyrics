# Memory Serves

It would be so nice to take you
I only ever try to make you smile
No matter what
We're gonna keep you occupied
But only at your place
Only at your place

It would be no price to pay
I only ever lie to make you smile
All kinds of dust are gonna keep me satisfied
But only at your place
Only at your place

Tonight a special memory serves me
And I'll wait to find the wrong way

Tonight a special memory serves me
And I'll wait to find

It's over
It's over
I feel like the feeling is like
It's over
Why is it so hard
To stay away
Why is it so hard

Tonight a special memory serves me
And I'll play to find that I'm gray

Tonight a special
I only memorize those dates I deny

And I forget why we'll say
Let's seize the day
You won't have to say that you'd love to
But baby please that you'd want to someday

It would be no price to pay
We began this
We began this our way
And I'll pay all live
Now we're saying
Cause it would be no price to pay

You don't have to say that you'd love to
But baby please that you'd want to
Someday

You don't have to say that you'd love to
But baby please that you'd want to
Someday

You don't have to say that you'd love to
But baby please that you'd want to
Someday
