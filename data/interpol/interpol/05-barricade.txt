# Barricade

I did not take to analysis
So I had to make up my mind
And hold it for awhile

I would not just leave you without a kiss
But I guess there must come a time
When there's no more tears to cry

Bees and snakes need homes
Need homes
Barricade

It starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away
To keep us away
And it kinda does

Starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away
Keep us away

I could not lean on the politics
Cause I didn't want to train my eye
To hold so short a time

Also I just don't know where
The blind could lead the sightless
But I still like to witness

Bees and snakes need homes
Need homes
Barricade

It starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away
To keep us away
And it kinda does

Starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away
Keep us away
Keep us all away

Full speed half blind
Full tilt decline
Return to past times
Full speed half blind

You know us
You know us

What we
Saw
Was a matter
Of fiction

And I'm sorry
And a plan
Say I'm sorry

Sometimes it feels like a barricade
To keep us away
Keep us away
And it kinda does

And how much fear can you fabricate
To keep us away
Keep us away
When you know us

Full speed half blind
Full tilt decline
We turn to past times
Full speed half blind

Full speed half blind
Full tilt decline
On to old times
Full speed half blind
