All that I see
Show me your ways
Teach me to meet my desires
With some grace

All that I fear
Don't turn away
And leave me to plead in this hole of a place
Cause what if I never break

Estuary
Won't you take me
Far away
Far away

All that I seek
Please police me
I want you to police me
But keep it clean

How have you been my day
Now let's take them away
That's why I told you

Strong as you've seen
Old as you behave
That's why I hold you

You will always obey
That's why I hold you

All that I feel
Capital ways
Teach me to grieve and conspire
With my age

All that I can see
Domestic spree
A seething routine
I could never navigate
Maybe I like to stray

No heart unseen
Will be left so clean
Not today
It's like you want it that way

All that I see
Is peaceful eyes drawn away from me
Drawn away from me
Drawn away from me
Drawn away from me

We would like to take the sights
That's why I hold you

And bring silence in disguise
That's why I hold you

We would like to meet the buyer
That's why I hold you

That is all your life

That's why I hold you
That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you
That's why I hold you

That is why I hold you dear
That's why I hold you
That's why I hold you dear
That's why I hold you

That is why I hold you dear
That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you dear
That's why I hold you

That's why I hold you dear
That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you dear
That's why I hold you

That is why I hold you dear
That's why I hold you
That is why I hold you dear
That's why I hold you

Hold you
Hold you
Hold you
Hold you
Hold you
Hold you
