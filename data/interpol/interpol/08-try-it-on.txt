# Try It On

I need the sunlight
To keep me above
These moderations

I always hoped for
Did all this work for
Some peace of mind
And just because

On this side
You wanna see that
There's no change
And somewhere to stay

But if you're right
I'll put my keys back
There's no change
And no hand to play

Please explore my love's endurance
And stay stay
Please enjoy my love's exhortations
No way
No fucking way no

On this side you wanna see that
There's no change and somewhere to stay
On this side you're gonna see that
There's no change and nowhere to stay

Try it on
Please try it on
Try it on
Try it on
Try it on
Oh please
Please try it on
Try it on
Try it on
Try it on

On this side
You're gonna see that
There's no change
And nowhere to stay
But if you're right
I'll put my keys back
There's no change
And nowhere to stay

There's nowhere to stay
There's nowhere to stay
There's nowhere to stay
Nowhere to stay
There's nowhere to stay
There's nowhere to stay
