# Always Malaise (The Man I Am)

Always you need me lover
For always release me lover

I want to give you the lowdown
I want to give you the face to face

Always is all I can give
Isn't quite what you take me for

I will act in a certain way
I control what I can
That's the man I am

Well it pains me to say
And I do what I can
That's the man I am

Always always always
Always release me lover

I want to give you the face to face

Won't let you go
Won't let you go
What'll you do

I want to miss some more

I'll relax in a certain way
I control what I can
That's the man I am

Well it pains me to say
And I do what I can
Coming out of the waste
That's the man I am
Clearing out of the shade
That's the man I am

Coming out of the waste
Clearing out of the shade

All that you've known be as it may
All that you've shown
Reach in and try all day
Coming out of the waste
I wanna try all day
Clearing out of the shade

All that I know is you'll be okay
Follow your soul and it ells you to fly away
Coming out of the waste
I wanna fly all day
Clearing out of the shade

All that you've known be as it may
All that you've shone
Coming out of the waste
Reach in and shine all day
Clearing out of the shade
I wanna shine all day
