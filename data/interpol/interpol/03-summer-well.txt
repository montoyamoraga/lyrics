# Summer Well

The fevered plastics that seal your body
They won't stop this rain hey hey
I was your eye in the night when the profits fell
I said it looks like you summer well

I want to stay magical
I want to stay yearning
Nobody told you
Nobody told you

I want to feel up on your life
I miss you
But it looks like you summered well

All the while all the protests that shined the same
But you will never notice
It's alright

I rely on the process don't mind the frame
They will never take this
Dream from me

It's alright
I need you back
It's alright
It's all the way behind us
It's alright

I miss you babe
I want you back
The signs we gave
Weren't those signs supposed to last

The rainy days
The summer's back
The signs we gave
So what was that

You know we have ways
To make the seasons touch these ones
So let me take this
Cover your eyes
Look away
Until it fades

All the while all the protests that shined the same
But you will never notice
It's alright

I rely on the process don't mind the frame
They will never take this
Dream from me

It's alright
Dream from me
It's alright
You sent me
It's alright
You sent me

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
You sent me
