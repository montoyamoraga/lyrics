# All Of The Ways

Tell me you're mine
Baby tell me you're mine
To break the ice

Does he make you smile
Does he fully embrace the way
Does he lead you to the fight
That you like

Who is this guy
I know the way
You will make it up

This twee neophyte
Does he know that I wait
For all time
Does he make you right

Does he say that he'd like to know you
Does he say that he wants to know
Does he say that he wants to know

All of the ways
You will make it up
Make it up for me
Make it up for me

Tell me you'll fight
Baby tell me it's hard to fake it
Time after time

Baby who is this guy
I know the way you will make it up
Does he say that he'd like to know you
Does he say that he wants to know
Does he say that he wants to know

All of the ways
You will make it up
Make it up for me
Make it up for me

All of the ways
You will make it up
Make it up for me
Make it up for me

I know the way
You will make it up
Make it up for me

I know the way
You will make it up
Make it up for me

I know and I know the way
You will make it up
Make it up for me

I know and I know the way
You will make it up
Make it up for me
