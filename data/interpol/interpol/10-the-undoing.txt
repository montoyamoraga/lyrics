# The Undoing

I was on my way
I was on my way to tell you
It's no good
I was on my way
Chasing my damage

I was chased thrilled and altered
Chasing my damage
Because I was chased thrilled and altered
And it raised me

Suele tener
Me suelto
Me suelto en el deshacer
Please
Al puro perder el ganar no compara
Me suelto
Me suelto en el deshacer

I always thought you had
Great style
Great style
And style was worthwhile

Because I was
I was on my way
Sobrevivir√©

Chasing my damage
Chasing
I was chased thrilled and altered
And it raised me

Chasing my damage
Because I was chased thrilled and altered
And it raised me
