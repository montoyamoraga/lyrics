# Leif Erikson

She says
It helps with the lights out
Her rabid glow
Is like braille to the night

She swears
I'm a slave to the details
But if your life is such a big joke
Why should I care

The clock is set for nine
But you know you're gonna make it eight
So that you two can take some time
Teach each other to reciprocate

She feels that my sentimental side
Should be held with kid gloves
But she doesn't know
That I left my urge in the icebox

She swears
I'm just prey for the female
Well then hook me up and throw me baby cakes
Cause I like to get hooked

The clock is set for nine
But you know you're gonna make it eight
All the people that you've loved
They're all bound to leave some keepsakes

I've been swinging all the time
Think it's time to learn your way
I picture you and me together
In the jungle it would be OK

I'll bring you when my lifeboat
Sails through the night
That is supposing that you
Don't sleep tonight

It's like learning a new language
Helps me catch up on my mime
If you don't bring up those lonely parts
This could be a good time
It's like learning a new language

You come here to me
We'll collect those lonely parts
And set them down
You come here to me

She says brief things
Her love's a pony
My love's subliminal

She says brief things
Her love's a pony
My love's subliminal
