# Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down

This one's called Stella was a diver and she was always down

When she walks down the street
She knows there's people watching
The building fronts are just fronts
To hide the people watching her

But she once fell through the street
Down a manhole in that bad way
The underground drip
Was just like her scuba days

Days
Daze
Days
Daze

She was all right because the sea was so airtight
She broke away
She was all right because the sea was so airtight
She broke away

She was all right but she can't come out tonight
She broke away
She was all right cause the sea was so tight
Airtight

She broke away broke away
She broke away broke away
She broke away broke away

She broke away

She lies in no place
She lies in nowhere
She lies in no place
She hides in nowhere
She hides in nowhere

At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
At the bottom of the ocean she dwells
From crevices caressed by fingers
And fat blue serpent swells

Stella
Stella
Oh Stella

Stella I love you
Stella I love you
Stella I love you

She was all right because the sea was so airtight
She broke away
She was all right because the sea was so airtight
She broke away

She was all right but she can't come out tonight
She broke away
She was all right yeah the sea was so tight
Airtight

She broke away broke away
She broke away broke away
She broke away broke away

She broke away

Well she was my catatonic sex toy love joy diver
Well she was my catatonic sex toy love drug diver
She went down down down there into the sea
Yeah she went down down down there
Down there for me right on

Oh yeah
Right on
So good
Oh yeah
Right on
So good
Oh yeah

There's something that's invisible
There's some things you can't hide
Trying to detect you when I'm sleeping
In a wave you say goodbye

There's something that's invisible
There's some things you can't hide
Trying to detect you when I'm sleeping
In a wave you say goodbye
