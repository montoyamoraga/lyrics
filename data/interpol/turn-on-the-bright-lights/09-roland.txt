Shh
Come on
Come on

Hey my best friend's a butcher he has sixteen knives
He carries them all over the town at least he tries
Oh look it stopped snowing

My best friend's from Poland and oh he has a beard
But they caught him with his case in a public place
That is what we had feared

He severed segments and secretly liked that
He always had the time to speak with me I liked him for that
He severed segments and secretly liked that
He always took the time
He always took the time

Come on now pussycat

Hey my best friend's a butcher he has sixteen knives
He carries them all over the town at least he tries
Oh look it stopped snowing

And my best friend's from Poland and oh he has a beard
But they caught him with his case in a public place
That is what we had feared

He severed segments and secretly liked that
He always had the time to speak with me I liked him for that
He severed segments and secretly liked that
What is this a throwaway
What is this a throwaway
He was growing on me
What is this a throwaway
What is this a throwaway
He was growing on me
