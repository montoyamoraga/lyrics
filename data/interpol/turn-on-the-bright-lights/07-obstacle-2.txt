# Obstacle 2

I'm gonna pull you in close
Gonna wrap you up tight
Gonna play with the braids
That you came here with tonight

I'm gonna hold your face
And toast the snow that fell
Because friends don't waste wine
When there's words to sell

I feel like love is in the kitchen
With a culinary eye
I think he's making something special
And I'm start enough to try

If you don't trust yourself for
At least one minute each day
Well you should trust in this girl
Cause loving is coming your ways

If you can fix me up girl
You'll go a long way

If you can fix me up girl
You'll go a long way

I'll stand by all this drinking
If it helps me through these days
Take my love in these small doses

It takes a long time
Just to get this all straight
Take my love in these small doses

I'll showcase on route seven
When I find the right place
Take my love in these small doses

It takes a long time
Just to get this all straight
Take my love in these small doses

In my mind
This is my free time

Because friends don't waste wine
When there's words to sell

If you can fix me up girl
You'll go a long way

If you can fix me up girl
You'll go a long way

I'll stand by all this drinking
If it helps me through these days
Take my love in these small doses

I've spent a long time
Corresponding in my own way
Take my love in these small doses

I'll showcase on route seven
When I find the right place
Take my love in these small doses

It takes a long time
Just to get this all straight
Take my love in these small doses

In my mind
This is my free time

To break it all away
Spend it all today
Spend it all today

It took time then I found you
It took time then I found you
It took time then I found you
It took time then I found you
