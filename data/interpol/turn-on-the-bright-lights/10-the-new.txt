# The New

I wish I could live free
I hope it's not beyond me
Settling down it takes time
One day we'll live together
And life will be better
I have it here yeah in my mind
Baby you know someday you'll slow
Baby my heart's been breaking

I gave a lot to you
I take a lot from you too
You slave a lot from me
Guess you could say
I gave you my edge

I can't pretend
I need to defend
Some part of me from you
I know I've spent some time a lying

I can't pretend
I don't need to defend
Some part of me from you
I know I've spent some time a lying

How am I doing

You're looking alright tonight
I think we should go

You're looking alright tonight
I think we should go
