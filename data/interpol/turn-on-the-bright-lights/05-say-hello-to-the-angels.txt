# Say Hello to the Angels

I want your silent parts
The parts the birds love
I know there's such a place

I had my back turned
You didn't realize
I'm lonely

You lack the things
To which I relate
But I see no harm

Come wait
Come wait
Come wait
It's over

Yeah
One two three
Do me

When I'm feeling lazy it's probably because
I'm saving all my energy to pick up when
You move into my airspace
You move into my airspace

And something's coming over me
I see you in the doorway
I can't control the part of me that swells up when
You move into my airspace
You move into my airspace

But each night
I bury my love around you
Oh each night
I bury my love around you
You're linked to my innocence

This is a concept
This is a bracelet
This isn't no intervention

This is a concept
This is a bracelet
This isn't no intervention

This isn't you yet
What you thought was such a conquest
Your hair is so pretty and red
Baby baby you're really the best

Can I get there this way
Yeah I think so
Can I get there this way
I think so

Can I get there this way
Can I get there this way
Can I get there this way
Can I get there this way

We should take a trip now to see new places
I'm sick of this town
I see my face has changed

We should take a trip now to see new places
I'm sick of this town
I see my face has changed

Say hello
Say hello
To the angels

Say hello
Say hello
To the angels
