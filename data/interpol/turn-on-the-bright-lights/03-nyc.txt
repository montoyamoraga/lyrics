# NYC

I had seven faces
Thought I knew which one to wear
But I'm sick of spending these lonely nights
Training myself not to care

The subway is a porno
Pavements they are a mess
I know you've supported me for a long time
Somehow I'm not impressed

But New York cares
Got to be some more change in my life
New York cares
Got to be some more change in my life
New York cares
Got to be some more change in my life
New York cares
Got to be some more change in my life

Subway she is a porno
And the pavements they are a mess
I know you've supported me for a long time
Somehow I'm not impressed

It's up to me now
Turn on the bright lights
Oh it's up to me now
Turn on the bright lights

But New York cares
Got to be some more change in my life
New York cares
Got to be some more change in my life
New York cares
Got to be some more change in my life
New York cares
Got to be some more change in my life

Got to be some more change in my life
It's up to me now
Turn on the bright lights
Got to be some more change in my life

Got to be some more change in my life
Oh it's up to me now
Turn on the bright lights
Got to be some more change in my life
