# Obstacle 1

I wish I could eat the sat off of your lost faded lips
We can cap the old times make playing only logical harm
We can cap the old lines make playing that nothing else will change

But she can read
She can read
She can read
She can read
She's bad

She can read
She can read
She can read
She's bad
Oh she's bad

But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never this face again
You go stabbing yourself in the neck

And we can find new ways of living
Make playing only logical harm
And we can top the old times
Clay-making that nothing else will change

But she can read
She can read
She can read
She can read
She's bad

She can read
She can read
She can read
She's bad
Oh she's bad

But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never this face again
You go stabbing yourself in the neck

But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
I'll never this place again
You go stabbing yourself in the neck

It's in the way that she posed
It's in the things that she puts in my head
Her stories are boring and stuff
She's always calling my bluff
She puts the she puts the weights into my little heart
And she gets in my room and she takes it apart
She puts the weights into my little heart
I said she puts the weights into my little heart

She puts the weight
She puts the weight
She puts the weight
She puts the weight

She puts the weight
She puts the weight
She puts the weight
She puts the weight

It's in the way that she walks
Her heaven is never enough
She puts the weights in my heart
She puts oh she puts the weights into my little heart
