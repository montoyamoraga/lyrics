# PDA

Yours is the only version of my desertion
That I could ever subscribe to
That is all that I can do

You are a past sinner the last winner
I'm raking all around me
Until the last drop is behind you

But you're so cute when you're frustrated dear
Yeah you're so cute when you're sedated oh dear

Sleep tight
Grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can

Sleep tight
Grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can

Sleep tight
Grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can

Sleep tonight
Simpleton
Sleep tonight
You're simpleton

Sleep tonight
Can I follow
Sleep tonight
What the hell

You're the only person who's completely certain
There's nothing here to be into
That is all that you can do

You are a past sinner the last winner
And everything we've come to
Makes you you you

But you cannot safely say
That while I will be away you will not consider sadyl
How you helped me to stray

And you will not reach me I am
Resenting a position that's past resentment
And now I can't consider
And now there is this distance so

Sleep tight
Grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can

Sleep tight
Grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can

Sleep tight
Grim rite
We have two hundred couches where you can

Sleep tonight
Simpleton
Sleep tonight
You're simpleton

Sleep tonight
Can I follow
Sleep tonight
What the hell

Something to say
Something to do
Nothing to say
There's nothing to do
