# Next Exit

We ain't goin' to the town
We're goin' to the city
Gonna track this shit around
And make this place a heart
To be a part of

We ain't goin' to the town
We're goin' to the city
Gonna track this shit around
And make this place a heart
To be a part of again

Goin'
We're goin'
We're goin'
And we're gone

Goin'
We're goin'
We're goin'
And we're gone

So baby make it with me
In preparation for tonight
We've got so much to leave
But that's not what makes this right
You've been building up steam
Ignited by this fight
So do this thing with me instead
Of tying on a tight one instead

Goin'
Goin'
Goin'
And we're gone

We ain't goin' to the town
We're goin' to the city
Gonna track this shit around
And make this place a heart
To be a part of again
