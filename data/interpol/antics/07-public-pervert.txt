# Public Pervert

If time is my vessel then learning to love
Might be my way back to sea
The flying the metal the turning above
These are just ways to be seen

We all get paid
Yeah some get faith before they die
Then through stars we will navigate
Through the holes in your eyes

How many days will it take to land
How many ways to reach abandon
Oh abandon

Oh so swoon baby starry nights
May our bodies remain
You move with me I'll treat you right baby
May our bodies remain

There is love to be made
So just stay here for this while
Perhaps heartstrings resuscitate
The fading sounds of your life

How many days will it take to land
How many ways to reach abandon
Oh abandon

So swoon baby starry nights
May our bodies remain
As deep we move I'll feed you light baby
May our bodies remain
Oh yeah in history I'll treat you right baby
I'm honest that way hey

Swoon baby starry nights
May our bodies remain
