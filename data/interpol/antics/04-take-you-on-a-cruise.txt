# Take You On A Cruise

I'm timeless like a broken watch
I make money like Fred Astaire
I see that you've come to resist me
I'm a pitbull in time
Your pretense is not what restricts me
It's the circles inside
The anatomy of kisses and a teacher who tries
Who knows how we'll disappear
Would you like to be my missus and in future with child
You know we can't get back from here
But we can get away

Baby don't you try to find me
Baby don't you try to fight
Baby don't you try to find me
Baby it will be alright

Along the way
Tears drown in the wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship in your life

We sail today
Tears drown in the wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship
Or receive a better tip in your life

I am the scavenger between the sheets of union
Lately I can't tell for sure whether machines turn anyone
I am the scavenger between the sheets of union
Lately I can't tell for sure whether machines turn anyone

Lady don't you try to find me
Lady there is no need to fight
Lady don't you try to find me
Lady it will be alright

We sail today
Tears drown in your wake of delight
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship in your life

Along the way
The sea will crowd us with lovers at night
There's nothing like this built today
You'll never see a finer ship
Or receive a better tip in your life

I see that you've come to resist me
I'm a pitbull in time

White goddess
Red goddess
Black temptress of the sea
You treat me right

Black goddess
Red goddess
White temptress of the sea
You treat me right

Oh my love we're sailing to Norway
Oh my love we're leaving tonight
Oh my love we're sailing to Norway
Oh my love we're leaving tonight
