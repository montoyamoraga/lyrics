# C'mere

It's way too late
To be this locked inside ourselves
The trouble is
That you're in love with someone else
It should be me
Oh it should be me

Sacred parts
Your getaways
You come along
On summer days
Tenderly
Tastefully

And so may
We make time
Try to find
Somebody else
This place is mine

You said today
You know exactly how I feel
I had my doubts
Little girl
I'm in love with something real
It could be me
That's changing

And so may
We make time
To try and find
Somebody else
Who has aligned

Now seasoned with health
Two lovers walk a lakeside mile
Try pleasing with stealth rodeo
See what stands long
Ending fast

Oh
How I love you
And in the evenings
When we are sleeping
We are sleeping
Oh we are sleeping

And so may
We make time
To try and find
Somebody else
Who has aligned

Now seasoned with health
Two lovers walk a lakeside mile
Try pleasing with stealth rodeo
See what stands long
Or ending fast
