# Length Of Love

This could be destiny
Oh sweetheart
I've had no sense of time
Since we started

I've got friends in need
Oh sweetheart
I've grown lengths and lengths
And lengths of love
Since we started this thing out

There is a bitter breed
Oh sweetheart
They will be watching you sometimes
With their bitter hearts

But we are through with these
Oh we're shifting the heartache
We want strong summer love
The more robust of blood
Just to stay awake
