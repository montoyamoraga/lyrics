# NARC

Touch your thighs I'm the lonely one
Remember that last sweat cause that was the right one
Oh all your mysteries are moving in the sun
I show some love and respect
Wanna get some love and respect

Baby you can see that the gazing eye won't lie
Don't give up your lover tonight
Cause it's just you me and this wire alright
Let's tend to the engine tonight

She found a lonely sound
She keeps on waiting for time out there
Oh love can you love me babe
Love is this loving babe
Is time turning around

Fest your eyes I'm the only one
Control me console me
Cause that's just how it should be done
Oh all your history's like fire from a busted gun
I show some love and respect
I don't wanna get a life of regret

But baby you can see that the gazing eye won't lie
Don't give up your lover tonight

She found a lonely sound
She keeps on waiting for time out there
Oh love can you love me babe
Love is this loving babe
Is time turning around

We slips into the bedroom
Babe you know me this is alright
Holding we'll make soon
Will sustain us through the night
Inside my bedroom baby
Touch me oh tonight
Poses we'll make some
Will reveal our sense of right

You should be in my space
You should be in my life
You should be in my space
You should be in my life
You could be in my space
