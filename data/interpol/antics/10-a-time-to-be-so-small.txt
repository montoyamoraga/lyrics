# A Time To Be So Small

We say you from the urchin's side from under the boat
We saw you making knots we saw you get the rope
The boy appearing on the deck you're making it lurch
The bubble of your interest's ready to burst

He whistles and he runs

We saw you in distraction a sleeping slow despair
Rehearsing interaction he wasn't even there
A creature is a creature though you wish you were the wind
The boat will not stop moving if you tie him up until the end

He whistles and he runs so hold him fast
Breathe the burn you want to let it last
He might succumb to what you haven't seen
He has a keen eye for what you used to be
When the cadaverous mob saves their doors for the dead men
You cannot leave
When the cadaverous mob saves its doors for the dead men
You cannot leave

When the cadaverous mob saves their doors for the dead men
You cannot leave
