# Twice As Hard

There were days of no surprise on the wing
When nobody cared but you
Outright we tried to feel a salvation
The proof of it was always you boo

If these times should signify my mistakes
Please give me power
These are all of my creations
Leaving me disavowed

Twice as hard
Twice as hard
I give it right back to you
I give it right back to you
Twice as hard
Twice as hard

I relied on fewer lies to let you in
Become my lover
So with all of my relations
One caves in on the other

Twice as hard
Twice as hard
I give it right back to you
I give it right back to you
Twice as hard
Twice as hard

All those nights of many lights fall away
Following beautiful hours
These are all of my creations
Veering me now towards you

Twice as hard
Twice as hard
I give it right back to you
I give it right back to you
Twice as hard
Twice as hard

Twice as hard
Twice as hard
Twice as hard
Twice as hard

Twice as hard
Twice as hard
Twice as hard
Twice as hard

Twice as hard
Twice as hard
