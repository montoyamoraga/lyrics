# Tidal Wave

Day by day
We watch the gold bar
Saved by fame
I see you and you're going far
You're truly at the door
Of some great admiration

Oh what a sweet serenade
And the night is still young
Oh there's a flood coming soon
And this rush hits me just like a

Last Friday
I seen you in the photo booth
You changed your name
The screen really takes to you
Yeah you're really breaking through
On some great accolades

Oh what a sweet Saturday
And the night is still young for love
Oh there's a flood coming soon
And this rush hits me just like

A tidal wave
A tidal wave
A tidal wave
A tidal wave

Oh there's a flood coming soon
And the night is still young for love
Feel the tug of the moon
Completely gone on

A tidal wave
A tidal wave
A tidal wave
A tidal wave
Completely gone

A tidal wave
A tidal wave
Completely gone

A tidal wave
A tidal wave
Completely gone

A tidal wave
A tidal wave
Completely gone

A tidal wave
A tidal wave
Completely gone
