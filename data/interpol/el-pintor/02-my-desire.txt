# My Desire

Be my desire
I'm a frustrated man
Summon us for peace
Do what we can

Feel my desire
Favor the bold
Some of us fall to the earth
These others roam
Besieged by desire

Come on baby
You played me out
You play me out
That looked like your chance to me

But you played me out
So now I gave you up
It's time for a change of heart

See my desire
No solemn moods
All of us are teammates
We stick to the rules
It's a real life desire

Come on baby
You played me out
You lay me out
That looked like your chance to me

But you played me out
Oh so now I gave you up
It's time for a change of heart

I've been there
I've been here
Erased

Be my desire
I'm a frustrated man
Some of us fell to the earth
These others ran
They flee my desire

Come on baby
You play me out
Oh you lay me out
So it's time for a change of heart

You played me out
So I gave you up
You won't find no scars on me

I've been there
I've been here
Erased

I've been there
I've been near
Erased
