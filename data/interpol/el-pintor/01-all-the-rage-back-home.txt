# All The Rage Back Home

When she went
Hey love come over
My head abounds
Oh the feeling

And she wept
Hold me again
I made no sound
Oh the beating

And she swore
Love is never done
So easily

And we went
Over again
My head abounds
Oh the feeling

She said
You don't need time
Be tame
You won't meet your mate inside
My faith won't lie

He said
You don't need mine
Behave
You wanna leave my lady lovers
Of my eighteen summers alone

She said
You don't read minds
Be patient
You won't leave me shaking
Leave me shaking

I keep falling
Maybe half the time
Maybe half the time

I keep falling
Maybe half the time
Maybe half the time

But it's all the rage back home
It's all the rage back home

When she said
Love come over
My head abounds
Oh what feeling

She said
You oughta refine
Be paid
You're gonna see my face in lights
My faith won't lie

But my sweet
You don't need time
Come away and just say you'll love me
Just say you'll love me
Alone

She said
You don't read minds
Be patient
You won't see me shaking
You have been mistaken

I keep falling
Maybe half the time
Maybe half the time

I keep falling
Maybe half the time
Maybe half the time

But it's all the rage back home
It's all the rage back home

All the rage back home
All the rage back home
All the rage

I keep falling
Maybe half the time
Maybe half the time

It's all the rage back home

I keep falling
Maybe half the time
Maybe half the time

It's all the rage back home

I keep falling
Maybe half the time
Maybe half the time

It's all the rage back home

All the rage back home
All the rage back home
