# Everything Is Wrong

Truly
Truly
Truly
Real

Enter the override
How we run the day
Sleeker and cheaper
The wind changed

Following deeper
They hear what I say
Spectral incentives
Have paved the way

Everything is wrong wrong
Everything is wrong

I guess we hope in time
What is now
Is overcome

Truly
Truly
Truly
Real

I think I know why
I say what I say
Inverse achievements
I rue the days

Am I more soulful
Am I coming down now
Can we start over
As agents of peace

Everything is wrong wrong
Everything is wrong

All we have is time
But my heart is going wrong

We're taking a part both of us
But nobody likes to wait

Everything is wrong truly wrong
Everything is wrong

Truly
Truly
Truly
Real

Oh love
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

Oh love
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

We made our home
Without begging your pardon
We made our home
With time alone

It's taking apart the best of us
And nobody likes to wait
Everything is wrong truly wrong
Everything is wrong
