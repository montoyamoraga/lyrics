# Same Town, New Story

Same town new story
They bridged a fated span
He was bound for a glory
She found her winning man

So I bet she stood by him
Through it all
I bet stood by him
She was pounding on the wall

She said it feels like the whole world
Is up on my shoulders
Feels like the whole world's
Coming down on me
Frightening

How many bombs went off
Cause he just had to play his hand
His lot is a woman's duty
And she was always tougher than
Same town new story

She said who's gonna save them from you
Same town new story
I ain't gonna chase another stake until he's gone

So I bet she stood by him
To the law
I bet she stood by him
When he was down
On his knees

She said
We're still alive
We are still alive

Feels like the whole world
Is up on my shoulders
Coming down

Feels like the whole world
Is up on my shoulders
Coming down

Feels like the whole world's
Coming down on me

Wide eyed
Venture so slowly
Venture so slowly

Wide eyed
Venture so slowly

Wide eyed
Venture so slowly
Venture so slowly

Why do I venture so slowly
Venture so slowly
