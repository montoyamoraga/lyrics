# Ancient Ways

Ooh fuck the ancient ways
They are heretofore
Shown no claim

Ooh got the time won't seek
They are oh still coming to paint the street
At the station

The city feeds us all like babes
And we've taken a bow
At the station

Ooh shape the fight through sound
Become dutifully bound
To the ground

Ooh fuck the ancient ways
They are ringing doorbells
They ran it by waste
At the station

The city needs us and all our names
Enterprise in her eyes
At the station

But beneath us an empire grows
Every stage we align
At the station

To be beaten by the weight of it
They are to be beaten by the weight
At the station

Come be people and enjoy our glow
Every change we allow
At the station

The city sees us all like babes
And we've taken a vow
At the station

To be beaten by the weight of it
They are beaten by the weight
At the station

Should we seek them for the sake of it
May we greet them right away
