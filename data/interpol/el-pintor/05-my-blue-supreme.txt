# My Blue Supreme

Fade out
You've already made a scene around me
Fade now
Just say that in the way you go by
It's my own time
Cruising in my blue Supreme
It's my own time

When love comes honey take it
Only one in a hundred make it
We fake until there's nothing to fake

There's someone that I'm dying to be
Cruising in my blue Supreme

Fade
You've already captured me alone
Fake out
Just say it in the way you go by
It's my own time
My own time

There's someone that I'm dying to be
Cruising in my blue Supreme

Someone that I'm dying to be
Cruising in my blue
Someone that I'm dying to be
Cruising in my blue
Cruising in my blue Supreme

Just say it in the way you go by
My own time
Cruising in my blue Supreme

When love comes honey show it
So many of us blow it
This kind of shit don't heal in a week
Cruising in my blue Supreme

Cruising in my blue Supreme
Someone that I'm dying to be
Cruising in my blue

But nothing ever comes for free
Cruising in my blue

Cruising in my blue Supreme
In my blue Supreme

Something that I'm trying to create
Just me alone my shoes and some shake
Cruising in my blue
Cruising in my blue Supreme
