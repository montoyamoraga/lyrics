# When  

When you know something  
How do you know that you know it  
How do you know that you know it  

When you know something  
How do you know that you know it  
How do you know that you know it  

They going tell you what to feel  
They going tell you you gonna fail
And you chip a tooth
But it was on the truth  
And we don't wait for someone to tell us  

I'm here to tell you don't listen them  
Listen to yourself but don't fall asleep in the restaurant  
Anyway the west one  
Anyway the west one  

Them the crazy ones we know better come on  
None of us so crazy as to try to explain it to them  
They don't wanna hear it  
And we just wanna keep living in America  
But come on  

We just wanna change the distribution of wealth  
The weapons industrial complex and the use of force by sundown  

Like I said the crazy ones  
No  
Them the crazy ones we know better come on  

We just wanna change the distribution of wealth  
The weapons industrial complex and the use of force by sundown  

Like I said the crazy ones  
No  
Them the crazy ones we know better come on
