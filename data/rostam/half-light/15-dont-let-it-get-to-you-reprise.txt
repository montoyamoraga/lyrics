# Don't Let It Get To You (Reprise)

Please
Don't let it get to you
Even if you don't realize it
It's still all up to you

Even if you don't
Even if you don't realize it
It's still all up to you

I want to
Even when it don't make sense
Even when it don't make sense
Actually I want to more
When it don't make sense

So please
Don't let it get to you
I know that you won't realize it
But it's still all up to you

I know that you won't
I know that you won't realize it
But it's still all up to you
