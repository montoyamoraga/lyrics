Sunlight on your eyelids
You were sleeping
Oh oh oh

Sunlight on your back
You were dreaming
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

And I lay inside a field
Beneath a cherry tree
And listen to the grass
And horses as they pass

And wake up in the light
Across the mountainside
And I sleep beside a fire
I built with burning tires 

Sunlight on your eyelids
You were sleeping
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Sunlight on your back
You were dreaming
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
