# Don't Let It Get To You

Please
Don't let it get to you
Even if you don't realize it
It's still all up to you

Even if you don't
Even if you don't realize it
It's still all up to you

I want to
Even when it don't make sense
Even when it don't make sense
Actually I want to more
When it don't make sense

So please
Don't let it get to you
I know that you won't realize it
But it's still all up to you

I know that you won't
I know that you won't realize it
But it's still all up to you

You're not gonna get it
Exactly how you want it
But that doesn't mean that 
You shouldn't try

It's not gonna feel
The way that you expected
And it's going to hurt
To figure it out

But if you're patient
And you're kind
I don't know why

It's no fun
And how come
I think of you now

Please
Don't let it get to you
Even if you don't realize it
It's still all up to you

Even if you don't
Even if you don't realize it
It's still all up to you
