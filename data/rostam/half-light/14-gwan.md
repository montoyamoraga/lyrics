Don't listen to me
I only believe myself
So I'm going somewhere
To do that alone

And then I see you
The light falls through the room
And all of it don't seem so hard

Do you ever get the sense
You're watching someone else
Your face against the glass
Across Eleventh Ave

Some people say they know
They never really know
They all wait for something
That never comes to them

But all of these dreams
Keep coming back to me slowly
Slowly

And sometimes I laugh
When I think about
How you know me
Yeah you know me

Wisdom comes to your heart
Down a shaft from afar
Pulls you out of bed
And into the noise

Whoever's up this late
You really still awake
Why can't you go to sleep
Like everybody else

And all of these dreams
Keep coming back to me slowly
Slowly

And sometimes I laugh
When I think about
How you know me
Yeah you know me

But all of these dreams
Keep coming back to me slowly
Slowly

And sometimes I laugh
When I think about
How you know me
Yeah you know me

But all of these dreams
Keep coming back to me slowly
Slowly

And sometimes I laugh
When I think about
How you know me
Yeah you know me

And when I woke up
From that dream
I was sleeping
In a basement

Leaves were falling
On the pavement
I was happy
In the city

Took a friend's car
To the ocean
Are you ready
Are you ready
