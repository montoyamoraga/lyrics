# Sumer

I was dead and born again oh no
And soon it will all feel so long ago

On the street I felt the daylight again
And heard the voices of all my friends

Coming up the stairs I felt
The summer and the thunder

Coming through the window off
The water and I wondered

I was dead and born again oh no
And soon it will all feel so long ago

On the street I felt the daylight again
And heard the voices of all my friends

Coming up the stairs I felt
The summer and the thunder

Coming through the window off
The water and I wondered
