# Warning Intruders

There was nothing I could say to keep you
There was nothing left that I could do

But I can't let go
And it burns me but no
I just keep holding on
To what I got 'til it's gone

If I hold you this close
It don't mean anything
If I tell you I can't lose you
It still don't mean anything

There was nothing I could say to keep you
There was nothing left that I could do

But I can't let go
And it burns me but no
I just keep holding on
To what I got 'til it's gone

If I hold you this close
It don't mean anything
If I tell you I can't lose you
It still don't mean anything

And I just keep holding on
To what I got 'til it's gone
I just keep holding on
To what I got 'til it's gone

And I just keep holding on
To what I got 'til it's gone
I just keep holding on
To what I got 'til it's gone

And I just keep holding on
To what I got 'til it's gone
I just keep holding on
To what I got 'til it's gone

So I wait up 'til it's dawn
I see the red in the horizon

Sometimes the colors run
I still see some of them

Sometimes the colors run
I could see all of them

Sometimes the colors run
I could see all of them
