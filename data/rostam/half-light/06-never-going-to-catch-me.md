# Never Going To Catch Me

Please try your best but know
You're never gonna catch me
I had my back turned
And I never saw it happening

They tell you everything
You'd ever want to believe
But I haven't had the chance to see
The way that everything collapses

Now now
Closer than you were before

Now now
Easier than it was before

Now now
Still not quite what you wanted so you

Have to start again
You have to start again

Please try your best but know
You're never gonna catch them
You'll had your back turned
And you'll never see it happening

I did my best to understand it if
You believe that they haven't had
The chance to see the way
The buildings each collapsed but

Now now
Closer than you were before

Now now
Easier than it was

Now now
Still not quite what you wanted so you

Have to start again
You have to start again

I come up from underground on Houston Street
I don't remember anything in front of me
I come up from underground on Thirteenth Street
I don't know exactly how to proceed

Please try your best but know
You're never gonna catch me
I had my back turned
And I never saw it happening

They tell you everything
You'd see want to believe
But I haven't had the chance to see
The way that everything collapses

Now now
Closer than you were before

Now now
Easier than it ever was

Now now
Still not quite what you wanted so you

Have to start again
You have to start again
