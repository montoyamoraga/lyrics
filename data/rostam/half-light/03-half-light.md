# Half-Light  

Somewhere in the half-light  
I could feel it coming true  
I know it and I know it  
But I did it just for you  

Baby are you getting cold  
My room is just down the hall
And if we stay the night  
I promise not to call  

Somewhere in the half-light  
I could feel it coming back   
I get it there's no future  
But can't see it through the cracks  

Baby is the door unlocked  
Is your bed getting cold  
I know if I stay the night  
You'll ask me to go  

But somewhere in the half-light  
I felt the morning coming through  
I know it and I know it  
But can't see it I refuse  

Baby all the lights came up  
What are you gonna do  
Baby all the lights came up  
What are you gonna do  

Baby all the lights came up  
What are you gonna do  
Baby all the lights came up  
What are you gonna do  

Baby all the lights came up  
What are you gonna do  
Baby all the lights came up  
What are you gonna do  

Are you gonna do  
Gonna do  

Baby all the lights came up to illuminate the room  
Blinded me I shut my eyes to see an imprint there of you  
I still think about it but there was nothing I could do  

Baby all the lights came down and illuminated you  
Blinded me I shut my eyes to see an imprint left of you  
Blinded me I shut my eyes and there was nothing I could do
