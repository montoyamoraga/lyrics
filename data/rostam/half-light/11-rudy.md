# Rudy

Rudy gonna smell that shit
In your clothes
Rudy gonna tell you just
What you know

Rudy gonna smell that shit
In your clothes
Rudy gonna tell you just
What you know

On the night that Rudy was born
Was a great thunderstorm and
Mama knew that Rudy was
Not like the other boys

Rudy said
I don't know
But you never did
And he kissed him

Rudy said
I won't be there
But you never were
And she missed him for it

Rudy said
What do you want
That nobody else
Has thought about

Rudy said
I want it now but
I don't know
How to say it
Anyway I thought it was

Please just once look at it
From the ground up
It's not what you thought
And it's awfully fucked up

Please just once look at it
From the ground up
It's not what you thought
And it's awfully fucked up

Pa pa pa
Pa pa pa
Pa pa pa
Pa pa pa

Rudy gonna smell that shit
In your clothes and
Rudy gonna tell you just
What you know yeah

Rudy gonna smell that shit
In your clothes
Rudy gonna tell you just
What you know

So Rudy looked out the door
Before he ran
Spent a moment there

Rudy took what he had
Sighed a prayer
Made his way downstairs

Rudy thought what did I do
That nobody else ain't sad about
Rudy said I want it now
But i don't know how to say it anyway
I thought it was alright

Please just once look at it
From the ground up
It's not what you thought
And it's awfully fucked up

Please just once look at it
From the ground up
It's not what you thought
And it's awfully fucked up
